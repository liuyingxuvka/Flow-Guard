FlowGuard Risk Purpose Header
Created with FlowGuard: https://github.com/liuyingxuvka/FlowGuard
Purpose: review model topology for future-use hazards before broad confidence.
Guards against: generic AI risk checklists, unanchored future-risk warnings,
old/new path disposition gaps, coarse terminal states, and local green evidence
being overclaimed for future use, duplicate business paths, and wrong-path
runtime proof.
Use before editing: when local FlowGuard evidence passes but topology shape may
still imply future-use hazards.
Run: python .flowguard/verification/owners/model_topology_hazard_review/run_checks.py

TOPOLOGY_HAZARD_NOTES_TEMPLATE = """# FlowGuard Model Topology Hazard Review Notes

This review is not a generic risk checklist. It starts from the model topology:
states, edges, side effects, terminal states, old/new paths, external
boundaries, parent/child compression, and business-path identity. Future-use
hazards should be promoted only when they name a concrete topology anchor.

Important business paths should name a stable path id, business intent, trigger,
expected terminal, state writes, side effects, equivalent paths, exclusive
paths, superseded old paths, compatibility disposition, and source/runtime
evidence ids when those affect confidence.

Use this route before broad done/release/publish confidence when model shape and
usage intent suggest hidden future-use risk. Unanchored AI concerns remain
observations. Anchored unresolved hazards route to Model Maturation, Model-Test
Alignment, DevelopmentProcessFlow, Architecture Reduction, or Risk Evidence
Ledger.
