LAYERED_BOUNDARY_PROOF_MODEL_TEMPLATE = '''"""FlowGuard Risk Purpose Header

Created with FlowGuard: https://github.com/liuyingxuvka/FlowGuard
Purpose: Review whether a parent model is fully covered by child models, child boundaries are disjoint, child evidence reattaches to the parent, and leaf code boundaries have complete finite Input x State coverage.
Guards against: parent coverage gaps, illegal child overlap, stale child evidence, coarse leaf models, and happy-path-only boundary testing.
Use before editing: Run this before claiming parent model, full-system, release, or done confidence from a parent/child FlowGuard model tree.
Run: python .flowguard/verification/owners/layered_boundary_proof/run_checks.py

LAYERED_BOUNDARY_PROOF_NOTES_TEMPLATE = """# FlowGuard Layered Boundary Proof Notes

Use this scaffold when a FlowGuard model tree needs a parent-to-leaf proof
chain.

## The Four Tables

- Parent coverage: every parent responsibility is owned by a child, parent,
  read-only boundary, shared kernel, bridge, or explicit out-of-scope
  disposition.
- Child disjointness: child models do not illegally share functions, state,
  side effects, invariants, risk classes, or responsibilities.
- Child reattachment: the parent consumes each child's current evidence id and
  only the inputs, outputs, state owners, side effects, and contracts that the
  parent is allowed to consume.
- Leaf boundary matrix: each leaf model has complete finite
  `Input x State -> Set(Output x State)` evidence, including next states, state
  writes, side effects, and error paths.
- When input and state axes are declared, the expected cells must equal their
  Cartesian product; unexpected cells or missing observed behavior are blockers.

If a leaf matrix is too large, split the model further or record an explicit
scoped exemption. Progress-only, skipped, stale, or release-only evidence is
not a green proof.
