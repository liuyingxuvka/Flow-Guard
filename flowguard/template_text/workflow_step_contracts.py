Created with FlowGuard: https://github.com/liuyingxuvka/FlowGuard
Purpose: Declare workflow steps as receipt-producing contracts so later steps and done/release claims cannot skip required work.
Guards against: skipped mandatory steps, wrong step order, premature completion claims, stale receipts after invalidation, and progress-only evidence being treated as completion.
Use before editing: Update this workflow step contract model when adding, removing, reordering, or renaming required process steps, receipts, claims, or validation evidence.

WORKFLOW_STEP_CONTRACTS_NOTES_TEMPLATE = """# FlowGuard workflow step contracts

## FlowGuard Risk Purpose Header

Created with FlowGuard: https://github.com/liuyingxuvka/FlowGuard
Purpose: Make required workflow steps explicit as receipts that later steps and claims must consume.
Guards against: skipped mandatory steps, premature done/release claims, stale receipts after invalidation, and hidden workflow shortcuts.
Use before editing: Update these contracts whenever the project changes required steps, evidence receipts, claim labels, or validation scope.
Run: python .flowguard/verification/owners/workflow_step_contracts/run_checks.py

## How to read this template

Each `WorkflowStepContract` is a small promise:

- `requires_receipts` says what must already be current.
- `produces_receipts` says what this step proves when it completes.
- `invalidates_receipts` says which older receipts stop being current.
- `required_for_claims` says which done, release, archive, or publish labels need this receipt.
- `skip_policy` says whether a skipped step is forbidden or must carry an explicit reason.

The same contract list can feed model exploration, DevelopmentProcessFlow
validation requirements, Model-Test Alignment obligations, and conformance
replay metadata checks.
