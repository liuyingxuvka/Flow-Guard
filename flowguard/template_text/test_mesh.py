Created with FlowGuard: https://github.com/liuyingxuvka/FlowGuard
Purpose: Review whether a parent test gate can trust child suites/scripts as owned validation regions.
Guards against: flat test splits, stale child suites, hidden skips, progress-only background runs, duplicate ownership, missing transition, ModelMesh closure, or artifact-payload matrix evidence, and release checks blocking routine confidence.
Use before editing: Update this TestMesh when changing validation layout, test partitions, transition or artifact payload matrices, child test scripts, slow regression gates, or background evidence contracts.

TEST_MESH_NOTES_TEMPLATE = """# FlowGuard TestMesh Notes

Use this scaffold to keep a project's validation hierarchy explicit.

## What TestMesh Reviews

- how a broad parent test gate is split into child suites or child scripts;
- which FlowGuard validation-structure model derived the target child
  suites/scripts before evidence is trusted;
- which child owns each behavior, state, command, invariant, or release
  partition;
- whether child suite/script evidence is current and strong enough for the
  parent;
- whether execution policy, planned/executed/failed/not-run counts,
  enumeration status, early-stop reason, diagnostic campaign id, and raw
  observation/cluster links are internally consistent and complete;
- whether transition coverage matrix cells have current child evidence when
  the matrix is too large or slow for direct Model-Test Alignment rows;
- whether ModelMesh closure projection cells have current child evidence when
  parent/child retry or rejection handoffs are too large or slow for direct
  Model-Test Alignment rows;
- whether ContractExhaustionMesh Cartesian coverage shards have current child
  evidence when local model coverage is generated as shard ids;
- whether artifact payload case ids have current child evidence when a
  file/work-package payload matrix is too large or slow for direct Model-Test
  Alignment rows;
- whether background logs include final exit/result artifacts;
- whether the required suite/member/cell/shard inventory and inventory
  revision are explicit and fully covered by terminal receipts;
- whether skipped, timed-out, not-run, or release-only checks remain visible.

A PID, periodic liveness signal, running flag, log line, or partial progress count proves only
that work is alive. It must never be promoted to a passing final receipt;
parent confidence waits for a terminal status, exit code, result artifact, and
complete required-id accounting.

TestMesh records what ran; DevelopmentProcessFlow chooses the process policy.
Fail-fast, collect-all, focused-first, bounded-collect, safe parallel shards,
and adaptive runs are all conditional. A complete campaign cannot hide not-run
work, while an early-stopped campaign must keep its stop reason visible.

Reused child evidence must set `result_reused=True` and bind a current
`TestResultReuseTicket` plus `ProofArtifactRef`. Matching labels, commands, or
old green output alone do not prove that the previous result still covers the
current source, dependencies, environment, obligations, and execution owner.

TestMesh is parallel to ModelMesh and StructureMesh: the object being split is
the test structure. The parent should consume child ownership and evidence
contracts instead of expanding every child test case into one giant parent graph.
A child suite can become its own parent gate when it needs another layer.

The target child-suite layout should be recorded as a model-derived split
before parent confidence is claimed. A partition map by itself is not enough.

TestMesh does not run your tests. Project adapters should run pytest, unittest,
Playwright, simulation runners, payload-fixture checks, or shell commands, then
feed structured evidence into the TestMesh model.
