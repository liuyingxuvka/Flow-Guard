"""FlowGuard Risk Purpose Header.

Created with FlowGuard:
https://github.com/liuyingxuvka/FlowGuard

Purpose:
Models the UI flow structure satellite rollout before implementation. The
model checks that the new route first creates/reviews a UI interaction model
and app-level journey coverage before deriving UI structure.

Guards against:
- treating UI flow structure as direct model-to-layout prose;
- publishing the skill without a checked UI interaction model stage;
- claiming route completion without structure derivation evidence;
- accepting a structure derivation that lacks parent/child UI topology.
- accepting a UI structure route that never reviewed duplicate information or
  overlapping same-level controls.
- accepting a complete-app UI release that never reviewed launch-to-terminal
  journey coverage.
- accepting complete-app UI coverage while visible/enabled controls or modeled
  events remain outside every journey, terminal allowance, or blindspot.
- accepting an implemented/runnable UI completion claim without aligning the
  feature model, UI journey model, and real browser/manual click-through
  evidence.
- accepting UI text hierarchy evidence without soft visual typography handoff
  guidance for reusable text treatments and intentional exceptions.
- accepting display, text, visible-surface, or observed-surface modeling before
  every in-scope content candidate has one supported visibility decision.
- accepting internal content on an ordinary UI surface because it has a
  display owner, purpose, or free-text rationale.
- accepting user-on-demand content that is visible by default, has no explicit
  reveal path, or cannot return to its hidden state.
- accepting complete-product UI language claims without every expected product
  surface, canonical typography/component/navigation/interaction/feedback/
  recovery/transition semantics, or bounded presentation-only exceptions.
- allowing the same business intent to drift across commitments or primary
  paths while pure UI interactions are forced to invent business authority.
- exposing internal identity, audit, evidence, or diagnostic fields as product
  language, or introducing a fourth content-visibility class.

Use before editing:
UI flow structure helper APIs, satellite skill wording, templates, docs, and
release routing.
