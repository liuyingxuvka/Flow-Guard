"""FlowGuard model for maintenance obligation memory.

FlowGuard Risk Purpose Header
Created with FlowGuard: https://github.com/liuyingxuvka/FlowGuard
Purpose: ensure remembered FlowGuard maintenance gaps are inherited by existing
routes instead of becoming a separate debt-hunting workflow.
Guards against: anchored obligations disappearing, unanchored observations
blocking unrelated work, self-resolved debt memory, and broad confidence claims
before owner-route evidence exists.
Modeled block shape: Input x State -> Set(Output x State).
Run: python .flowguard/verification/owners/maintenance_obligation_memory/run_checks.py
