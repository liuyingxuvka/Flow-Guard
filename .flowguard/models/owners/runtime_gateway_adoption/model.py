"""FlowGuard Risk Purpose Header.

Created with FlowGuard:
https://github.com/liuyingxuvka/FlowGuard

Purpose:
Reviews Runtime Gateway Adoption evidence for critical state writer inventory.

Guards against:
- claiming runtime-gateway protection with only an opaque inventory id;
- using stale or non-passing writer inventory as proof;
- leaving a critical state surface uncovered by structured writer inventory;
- scoping out a discovered writer without a reason;
- accepting inventory evidence with no proof artifact.

Run:
python .flowguard/verification/owners/runtime_gateway_adoption/run_checks.py
