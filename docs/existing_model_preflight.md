# Existing Model Preflight

Existing Model Preflight is FlowGuard's companion route for work inside an
existing modeled system. It makes the current model map visible before an agent
discusses, proposes, or implements a non-trivial change.

Use the plain rule:

```text
Understand the existing FlowGuard model boundary before creating a new one.
```

## Use Cases

Use it when a task touches an existing modeled system and involves:

- feature or behavior changes;
- bug fixes or post-runtime model misses;
- architecture proposals or module split ideas;
- UI flow, UI state, or UI implementation changes;
- test strategy, validation, or evidence changes;
- prompt, skill, or agent-workflow changes;
- parent/child model, release, or process confidence changes.

Skip it for typo-only edits, formatting-only work, direct command answers, pure
read-only explanations, or greenfield work with no existing model context.

For non-trivial bug fixes, run at least light preflight before Model-Miss
Review. The point is to identify which existing model owns the failing behavior
before adding a new model, test boundary, or alternate path.

For behavior-ledger work, preflight is the owner lookup step. For added,
changed, removed, replaced, or model-miss-triggered behavior, record the
affected commitment ids, primary owner model, likely sibling models, and whether
the existing owner should be extended, split into a child model, or blocked for
manual review. Do not create a second owner model simply because the old one
missed a branch.

## Plane-First Commitment Lookup

When the canonical behavior ledger is present, project preflight queries it
before scanning paths. The caller supplies or resolves one primary plane:
`product_runtime`, `agent_operation`, or `development_process`. The report then
keeps three groups separate:

- `primary_commitment_hits`: same-plane candidates that may guide the current work;
- `related_commitment_hits`: typed targets, governing processes, or evidence sources;
- `candidate_commitment_hits`: unresolved candidates when the plane is ambiguous.

The report also records `behavior_lookup_status`, `primary_behavior_plane`,
`plane_ambiguity`, `ledger_fingerprint`, and `behavior_lookup_reason`.
`performed` means canonical lookup completed. `fallback` means the path/model
inventory supplied partial context after a blocked or unavailable ledger.
`blocked` and ambiguity are visible gaps, not permission to mix all planes into
one instruction list. Related product context never makes an AI/process step
the owner of product behavior.

## Light And Full Modes

Light mode is for discussion and early analysis. It records likely relevant
models, existing ownership, a reuse-first direction, and the likely downstream
FlowGuard route.

Full mode is for implementation, OpenSpec proposals, major architecture
decisions, and risky behavior changes. It records searched paths, relevant
models, ownership snapshots, reuse decisions, duplicate-boundary risks,
downstream routes, and stale or no-model-found gaps.

## Public API

The main objects are:

- `ModelContextHit`: one existing model that may own the requested behavior.
  Parent hits with child models can also record the current layered proof
  evidence id plus parent coverage, child disjointness, child reattachment, and
  leaf boundary-matrix status. Field-bearing hits can record `fields_owned`
  when a field lifecycle or behavior field already belongs to that model.
- `ExistingOwnershipSnapshot`: FunctionBlock, state, side-effect,
  public-entrypoint, field, and responsibility ownership extracted from model
  hits.
- `DuplicateBoundaryRisk`: an overlap between a proposed boundary and an
  existing owner.
- `ExistingModelPreflight`: the light or full preflight report.
- `ExistingModelPreflightReport`: structured review output.
- `BehaviorLookupQuery`, `BehaviorCommitmentHit`, and `BehaviorLookupReport`:
  the existing BCL/preflight-owned, plane-first recall objects.
- `existing_model_preflight_from_project(...)`: queries the canonical ledger
  first, then supplements the selected owner context with project path inventory.
- `review_existing_model_preflight(preflight)`: the executable checker.

## Example

```python
from flowguard import (
    ExistingModelPreflight,
    ExistingOwnershipSnapshot,
    ModelContextHit,
    REUSE_DECISION_EXTEND_EXISTING,
    review_existing_model_preflight,
)


preflight = ExistingModelPreflight(
    "router-preflight",
    "Extend router scheduling behavior",
    mode="full",
    model_search_performed=True,
    search_paths=(".flowguard/models/owners/router", "docs"),
    relevant_models=(
        ModelContextHit(
            "router-flow",
            model_path=".flowguard/models/owners/router/model.py",
            responsibilities=("route scheduling",),
            function_blocks=("RouteTask",),
            state_owned=("pending_tasks",),
            side_effects_owned=("dispatch_task",),
            public_entrypoints=("router.dispatch",),
            child_model_ids=("router-dispatch-leaf",),
            layered_proof_evidence_id="router-layered:2026-05-22",
            parent_coverage_status="passed",
            child_disjointness_status="passed",
            child_reattachment_status="passed",
            leaf_boundary_matrix_status="passed",
        ),
    ),
    ownership_snapshot=ExistingOwnershipSnapshot(
        function_block_owners=(("RouteTask", "router-flow"),),
        state_owners=(("pending_tasks", "router-flow"),),
        side_effect_owners=(("dispatch_task", "router-flow"),),
        public_entrypoint_owners=(("router.dispatch", "router-flow"),),
        field_owners=(("field:dispatch_mode", "router-flow"),),
    ),
    reuse_decision=REUSE_DECISION_EXTEND_EXISTING,
    downstream_routes=("field_lifecycle_mesh", "development_process_flow"),
    behavior_field_ids=("field:dispatch_mode",),
    field_lifecycle_model_ids=("router-flow",),
    rationale="The existing router model owns task dispatch, so extend it.",
)

report = review_existing_model_preflight(preflight)
print(report.format_text())
```

For a ready scaffold, run:

```powershell
python -m flowguard existing-model-preflight-template --output .
```

To inspect the commitment lookup without changing the ledger, run:

```powershell
python -m flowguard behavior-commitment-query "start the UI test and check the port bridge" --root . --plane agent_operation --term port_bridge --json
```

This helper improves recall and explains why a model was selected. It does not
execute a workflow, require a formal model for every ordinary action, or prove
that a future agent will follow the hit.

## Relationship To Other Routes

Existing Model Preflight does not implement the change. It supplies the model
map to the route that owns the concrete work:

- Code Structure Recommendation derives implementation structure.
- ModelMesh governs parent/child model confidence.
- Layered boundary proof joins parent coverage, child disjointness, child
  reattachment, and leaf boundary-matrix status when parent confidence depends
  on child models.
- StructureMesh governs existing code splits.
- UI Flow Structure governs UI behavior and implemented UI evidence.
- Model-Miss Review repairs models after runtime/test failures.
- DevelopmentProcessFlow governs staged work and evidence freshness.
- Risk Evidence Ledger consumes the relevant model ids, evidence ids, scoped
  gaps, and reuse decisions before a final full-confidence claim.

The preflight catches a different failure: proposing a new system before
checking the one already modeled. Its output tells the ledger which existing
model boundary owns the risk; it does not prove the tests or runtime evidence
by itself.

When layered proof is in scope, preflight should surface the existing parent,
child, and leaf model ids plus any duplicate-boundary risks before a new model
or test boundary is added.

## Field Lifecycle Handoff

If the task changes fields that affect routing, state, permissions, schema,
migration, replay, side effects, or external contracts, record
`behavior_field_ids`, `field_lifecycle_model_ids`, and any
`field_lifecycle_gap_ids`. Full preflight should name `field_lifecycle_mesh` as
a downstream route before code changes. Presentation-only or metadata fields
can be scoped out, but the scoped-out reason belongs in FieldLifecycleMesh, not
in a hidden assumption.
## Read-only WorkContext after plane lookup

Declared WorkContexts are attached only after canonical plane-first commitment
lookup. Every context preserves its subject lane, adapter, native work,
artifact identities, fingerprints, and read-only flag. A planning context
cannot own a product-runtime commitment or any FlowGuard execution evidence.
See [`work_context.md`](work_context.md).
