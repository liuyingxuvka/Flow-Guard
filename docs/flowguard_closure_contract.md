# FlowGuard Closure Contract

Complete FlowGuard use is not a mode. It is the contract that must be current
before a task can claim full done, release, publish, or production confidence
from FlowGuard evidence.

The thin model-first path remains the entry shape:

```text
risky boundary -> Input x State -> Set(Output x State)
-> one invariant or scenario -> run checks
-> inspect counterexample -> escalate only if a named risk requires it
```

That path can support a bounded local claim. It does not by itself support a
broad completion claim. A broad claim needs the closure contract for every
in-scope risk boundary that the result depends on.

## Executable Review Helper

Use `review_flowguard_closure_contract()` to turn the closure contract into a
machine-checkable final gate. The helper consumes summaries from existing
routes; it does not replace the route that owns each proof.

Build a `FlowGuardClosureContractPlan` with:

- `RuntimeTraceMapping` rows for runtime traces mapped to model obligations.
- `ArtifactInvalidation` rows for changed files or generated artifacts that can
  stale older evidence.
- `ModelQualitySignal` rows for hidden state, missing side effects, owner
  ambiguity, helper-only proof, missing public boundary, or parent/child
  evidence gaps.
- `SameClassMissClosure` rows for observed failures plus ContractExhaustionMesh
  case proof.
- `RuntimeGatewayInventoryClosure` rows for critical runtime state writer
  inventory and gateway adoption evidence.
- `field_lifecycle_reports` or `ClosureEvidenceReport` rows with
  `field_lifecycle_mesh` kind when behavior-bearing fields, replacements, or
  old-field disposition are in scope.
- `ClosureEvidenceReport` rows for the Risk Evidence Ledger and route reports
  that the final claim consumes.
- For UI source-based or mixed full claims, a `ClosureEvidenceReport` with
  `report_kind="ui_source_baseline_alignment"` when
  `require_ui_source_baseline_alignment=True`.
- For UI full claims, a `ClosureEvidenceReport` with
  `report_kind="ui_done_claim_review"` when
  `require_ui_done_claim_review=True`.

The report returns `flowguard_closure_full_confidence`,
`flowguard_closure_scoped_confidence`, or `flowguard_closure_blocked`. A scoped
report is still not a full-confidence claim.

The Risk Evidence Ledger is the sole broad-confidence owner. ClosureContract
requires exactly one terminal RiskLedger report, verifies its canonical
decision/confidence pair and exact maturation receipt identity, and preserves
that confidence when terminal integrity passes. If other required material is
scoped while RiskLedger says full, closure reports an agreement failure; it
does not calculate a new risk score. Missing, duplicate, stale, or mismatched
RiskLedger reports block.

To create a project scaffold:

```bash
python -m flowguard closure-contract-template --output .
python .flowguard/verification/owners/closure_contract/run_checks.py
```

## Required Gates

Use the gates that match the claim:

- Plan/risk intake: current source evidence, user-facing risk surfaces,
  omitted/out-of-scope reasons, and historical miss context are declared.
- Existing model ownership: current model boundaries have been consulted, or a
  new boundary is justified.
- Model obligation: the relevant `Input x State -> Set(Output x State)` model,
  invariant, scenario, replay, or parent/child obligation is current.
- Model-miss or bug repair: every non-trivial in-scope bug class has the
  observed failure, root-cause backpropagation when a prior claim existed, and
  a ContractExhaustionMesh same-class or finite-boundary case when practical.
- Model-test/code alignment: model obligations, code contracts, code-boundary
  observations, and test evidence line up at the external boundary being
  claimed.
- Legacy path disposition: old, fallback, compatibility, or alternate paths
  left reachable by the repair are deleted, blocked, delegated to a repaired
  contract, same-contract repaired, or explicitly scoped with a reason.
- Field lifecycle: behavior-bearing fields are projected into model
  obligations and code contracts, display-only fields are scoped out with
  reasons, and old/replaced/deprecated fields have closing disposition
  evidence. Broad field claims also need minimal route refs for the relevant
  gate, negative/failure proof, and replay evidence.
- Obligation-family parity: when related obligations share one confidence
  claim, each sibling has the required mechanism evidence from allowed
  provenance sources, or the family gap stays visible.
- Model-miss finite closure: after a post-green miss, one exact commitment,
  primary owner, and blueprint gap select the affected scope; current
  canonical relations are materialized as ContractExhaustion cases with
  oracles before broad closure is restored.
- Runtime gateway adoption: when the claim says FlowGuard protects production
  state mutation, every critical state surface has complete writer inventory,
  gateway ownership, mediated write observations, and current step, boundary,
  replay, and proof evidence.
- Runtime path alignment: when the claim depends on real code following the
  model's node path, a current `runtime_path_alignment` report exists so full
  confidence cannot rest on anonymous progress logs.
- Mesh or layered boundary proof: parent/child model or test confidence
  consumes current child evidence and finite leaf boundary-matrix evidence when
  required.
- Model maturation: post-code, post-miss, model-test, mesh, code-boundary, or
  freshness signals that say the model is too coarse, stale, or disconnected
  have been resolved, or the claim is explicitly scoped down.
- Evidence freshness: later edits, peer writes, adapter changes, generated
  artifacts, and long-running checks have not made earlier evidence stale.
- Risk Evidence Ledger: user risks connect to model obligations, owner code
  contracts, model-code-test binding rows, ContractExhaustion coverage,
  independently verified ModelMaturation evidence, split gates, and current
  proof evidence.
- UI Done Claim: when the final statement says a UI is complete, runnable, or
  wired, the closure package includes current observed real-surface inventory,
  enabled-control functional chains, human-operability review,
  `ui_source_baseline_alignment` evidence for source-based or mixed scopes,
  source-baseline interaction semantics when applicable, implementation
  validation, native-dialog/manual blindspots, and no
  `planned:*` evidence standing in for observation.
- Typed claim chain: broad claims consume the right support type instead of
  promoting plan-only, model-only, or test-only evidence into production
  confidence.

## Reporting Rule

If a required gate is missing, stale, skipped, progress-only, release-only,
internal-path-only, a direct runtime write can bypass the declared gateway, or
the gate is explicitly scoped out, report the result as partial or scoped
FlowGuard evidence. Do not say FlowGuard is complete for that claim.

For UI work, if manual signoff is still missing, a native dialog was only
planned but not observed, any evidence is still `planned`, or the UI model does
not cover a real visible item, the final answer should say the base repair is
complete but release/full UI confidence is not complete.

If a later runtime, test, replay, log, manual validation failure, or
non-trivial bug report appears after a green FlowGuard result, treat it as a
closure-contract miss until Model-Miss Review has rebound the exact commitment
and blueprint gap, materialized the finite canonical relations as
ContractExhaustion cases, repaired owner code/test binding, replayed affected
topology and parent evidence, closed or scoped ModelMaturation, refreshed
process evidence, and updated the ledger and claim chain.
If the miss or replacement involved fields, include FieldLifecycleMesh and
old-field disposition repair in that same closure chain.

## What This Does Not Mean

The closure contract does not claim that arbitrary unmodeled behavior is bug
free. It means FlowGuard cannot honestly report green completion while a
declared in-scope risk is unsupported by the current evidence chain.
