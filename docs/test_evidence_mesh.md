# Test Evidence Mesh

Test Evidence Mesh is for projects where validation is becoming too large,
expensive, or broad to treat as one flat test command, script, or suite.

It is the test-side sibling of ModelMesh and StructureMesh. ModelMesh
partitions large models into child models, StructureMesh partitions large code
structures into child modules/scripts, and TestMesh partitions large test
structures into child suites/scripts.

Use the plain mental model:

```text
Parent test gate = total validation contract
Child suite/script = owned validation region
TestMesh review  = checks whether child evidence can support the parent gate
```

TestMesh does not run pytest, unittest, Playwright, shell scripts, or release
jobs. Project adapters run those commands and pass structured evidence into
FlowGuard. FlowGuard then checks coverage, ownership, freshness, skipped tests,
background completion, and routine-vs-release confidence.

For a specification work package, one check execution is one TestMesh child.
All mapped tasks and obligations remain consumer references on that child; they
do not create copied receipts or pretend that one command ran several times.
`reused-current` needs the native reuse ticket and exact command/input/tool/
environment/coverage identity. Cross-change reuse also needs provider-declared
`cross_change_safe`; caller preference alone cannot widen the boundary.

For a same-intent product-language/path-reuse claim, the parent boundary also
declares the required inventory revision and every required surface,
materialized obligation, family member, transition cell, ContractExhaustion
case, and shard. Passing only the smaller set a caller happened to register is
not complete evidence. A background PID, heartbeat, log line, or running status
is liveness only; pass requires a terminal receipt with result artifact,
fingerprint, covered ids, and current artifact/verifier versions.

The parent test gate should not inline every child test case, fixture, or
internal state route. It should consume each child suite/script as a contract:
owned partition, freshness rule, result status, skipped visibility, and output
evidence. A child can become its own parent gate when its internal test layout
needs another split.

Before the parent gate trusts a child-suite layout, it should record the target
split derivation from a FlowGuard validation-structure model. The derivation
names the source model, target child suites/scripts, covered partition items,
state owner fields, side-effect owner fields, and rationale for the validation
split. A partition map without this derivation is not enough for green parent
confidence.

## When To Trigger It

Run a TestMesh review when test execution or validation confidence needs a
layered plan:

- a routine test run is taking long enough that agents keep skipping or timing
  it out;
- one large regression command, test script, or suite mixes unrelated behavior,
  state, side effects, or release gates;
- a broad suite should be split into child suites/scripts with explicit owned
  validation regions;
- a parent validation claim depends on several child commands or background
  jobs;
- skipped, stale, timeout, or progress-only evidence could be hidden inside a
  green summary;
- a release-only suite should stay visible without blocking routine local
  confidence.
- a model-miss repair needs broad same-class coverage, such as parameterized
  variants, property tests, seeded fuzz, background shards, or release-only
  regressions that are too large for a direct Model-Test Alignment row set.
  The case ids should come from ContractExhaustionMesh, not from local prose
  examples.
- a transition coverage matrix is too large, slow, UI/browser-heavy, or
  release-only to prove with one flat direct evidence row set.
- an import/export, generated artifact, save/load, or AI work-package payload
  matrix is too large, slow, manual-heavy, or release-only to prove with one
  flat direct evidence row set.
- a ContractExhaustionMesh report routes canonical bad-case ids to TestMesh
  through `contract_exhaustion_to_test_mesh_cell_ids(...)`.
- a ContractExhaustionMesh model-local Cartesian report routes grouped coverage
  to TestMesh through `contract_exhaustion_to_test_mesh_shard_ids(...)`.

Automatic split diagnostics provide the trigger before a broad test result is
accepted as enough. When direct validation evidence reports slow duration,
large test counts, broad obligation coverage, background progress-only logs, or
release-only scope, `review_auto_mesh_splits()` routes the candidate to
TestMesh and keeps parent validation confidence blocked or scoped until current
child-suite evidence is consumed.

This is different from hierarchical model mesh only in what is being split.
Hierarchical model mesh governs FlowGuard model boundaries. TestMesh governs
test and validation boundaries.

## Partition Ownership

## Target Split Derivation

Each parent test gate should include a `TestTargetSplitDerivation`:

- `source_model_id`: the FlowGuard validation-structure model used to derive
  the split;
- `target_suite_ids`: child suites or scripts in the target layout;
- `covered_partition_item_ids`: parent validation partitions covered by the
  split;
- `state_owner_fields` and `side_effect_owner_fields`: ownership boundaries
  that shaped the split;
- `rationale`: why this suite/script layout follows from the model.

Missing source, unknown target suites, incomplete partition coverage, or
prose-only derivations block parent gate confidence.

Each parent test gate should declare partition items. A partition item can name
a behavior, state field, module, command, side effect, invariant, or release
boundary. Ownership is explicit:

- `child`: one child suite owns the item;
- `parent`: the parent gate owns the item directly;
- `read_only`: a suite observes the item but does not own it;
- `shared_kernel`: a deliberately shared validation kernel owns the item.

Missing owners are coverage gaps. Duplicate owners for the same partition,
state write, or side effect are ownership conflicts unless the overlap is
declared read-only or shared-kernel.

## Evidence Contracts

Each child suite or child test script reports a `TestSuiteEvidence` summary:

- command and layer;
- result status such as `passed`, `failed`, `timeout`, `running`, or `not_run`;
- diagnostic boundary (`targeted`, `declared_complete`, or `budgeted`) plus
  planned, executed, failed, and not-run counts;
- the diagnostic campaign id and a not-run reason whenever valid planned work
  remains outside the executed boundary;
- stable Finding Ledger ids for failures, so later grouping cannot erase or
  replace the source findings;
- evidence tier and freshness;
- selected, total, and skipped test counts;
- whether skipped tests are visible;
- duration, timeout, exit code, and result path;
- background log root and final artifact flags;
- `inventory_revision`, owned inventory item ids, and a unique `run_id`;
- final `terminal_status`, exit code, concrete result path,
  `result_fingerprint`, `covered_obligation_ids`, `artifact_version`, and
  `verifier_version`;
- optional `proof_artifact` for strict proof of the concrete suite result;
- optional `result_reused=True` plus `reuse_ticket=TestResultReuseTicket(...)`
  when an old suite result is reused because command, test source, tested
  artifact, dependency, environment, result fingerprint, and coverage scope are
  still current;
- owned state and side effects;
- owned artifact payload contract ids and case ids when the child suite proves
  synthetic file or work-package cases for downstream Model-Test Alignment;
- owned ContractExhaustionMesh coverage shard ids when the child suite proves
  a generated Cartesian shard for downstream model coverage receipts;
- not-run and stale reasons.

These fields describe what actually ran; they do not prescribe one universal
order. Counts must satisfy `planned = executed + not_run` and
`failed <= executed`. A `declared_complete` boundary cannot hide not-run work;
`targeted` and `budgeted` boundaries may leave work outside the run only when
the reason remains visible. Parallel execution is a separate DPF choice and
requires current isolation evidence.

Progress output is not completion evidence. A background suite is complete only
when all final-receipt fields above exist, terminal status is `passed`, exit
code is 0, the required ids are covered, final artifacts exist, and the run is
not progress-only. PID disappearance, heartbeat, logs, or a parent command that
ended without its canonical result file remain incomplete.

For the behavior-plane upgrade, keep at least these child partitions explicit:
focused lookup/behavior/contracts/API/skill checks, static skill governance,
isolated skill installation/parity, focused project models, full registered
models, full Python tests, project audit, and strict OpenSpec validation. Each
partition needs its own terminal receipt; a green self-maintenance model cannot
substitute for any missing child.
If a child suite reuses a previous result, TestMesh requires a current reuse
ticket and a current proof artifact before the child can support parent
confidence. A `passed` status string alone is not enough for reused evidence.

When a final FlowGuard confidence claim depends on these suites, feed each
child suite's evidence id, status, freshness, and scope into the Risk Evidence
Ledger. TestMesh owns the validation hierarchy; the ledger owns the final
"does this evidence support this user risk?" claim boundary.

For model-miss repair, the parent gate should keep the observed regression and
ContractExhaustionMesh same-class coverage distinct. A child suite can own the
observed case, while another owns the generated case ids through parameterized
tests, property checks, seeded fuzz, or release-only runs. Routine confidence remains
scoped until release-only same-class evidence is current.

For layered boundary proof, TestMesh can own the suite/script hierarchy that
produces leaf boundary evidence, but it does not by itself prove the leaf
matrix. The layered proof still needs every finite
`Input x State -> Set(Output x State)` cell, the evidence id for that cell, and
a current pass status.

When a parent gate declares `required_leaf_cell_ids`, each id must be owned by
a child `TestSuiteEvidence` row through `owned_leaf_cell_ids`. Missing, stale,
skipped, progress-only, background-incomplete, non-passing, or invalidly reused
owners do not support the parent gate.

When a parent gate declares `required_coverage_shard_ids`, each shard id must
be owned by a current passing child row through `owned_coverage_shard_ids`.
This is separate from ordinary leaf cells: a shard proves a bounded slice of a
generated ContractExhaustionMesh Cartesian matrix, not a single transition
cell.

Transition coverage matrices can feed this same surface. Use
`transition_coverage_to_required_leaf_cell_ids(...)` to produce required cell
ids, register those ids as partition items, and let child suites own the ids
they actually prove. TestMesh checks evidence freshness and ownership for the
cells; Model-Test Alignment still owns whether those cells bind the declared
transition obligations, owner code contracts, and current external-contract
test evidence.

ModelMesh closure models can feed the same path after
`model_mesh_closure_to_transition_coverage(...)` projects parent/child closure
transitions into transition cells. Retry or rejection cells generated from
repeated input tokens should be owned by child suites that prove failure,
negative, replay, and no-delta feedback behavior, not only the happy path.

Artifact payload matrices can also feed this surface. Child suites can own
required payload case ids and result artifacts, but TestMesh only checks
partition ownership and evidence freshness. Model-Test Alignment still owns
whether each observed payload status, output, error path, state write, side
effect, and round-trip result from the real payload surface matches the
`ArtifactPayloadContract`.

## Routine Versus Release

`TEST_SCOPE_ROUTINE` lets teams keep a fast local gate green while reporting
release-only obligations as deferred warnings. This is useful when a slow full
regression is not required for every local slice.

`TEST_SCOPE_RELEASE` is stricter. Release-required suites must be current and
passed before the parent can report release confidence.
