# API Surface Layers

FlowGuard has one core model and route-specific helper layers. The layers are
named so AI coding agents can start from one formal path and then open only the
route helpers that own the current risk.

The executable core is still:

```text
FunctionBlock: Input x State -> Set(Output x State)
Workflow = composed FunctionBlocks
formal runner = deterministic finite model checks plus evidence gates
```

The formal minimum useful entry for new or deepened models is:

```text
risky boundary -> RiskIntent -> Input x State -> Set(Output x State)
-> MinimumModelContract + KnownBadProof
-> FlowGuardCheckPlan -> run_model_first_checks
-> inspect counterexample/gaps
```

Template work is a separate route-scoped operation. It enters this flow only
when the caller explicitly requests template reuse/publication or current
executable evidence identifies a bounded stable pattern intended for use
outside the target project.

The deterministic finite exploration engine remains an internal execution
primitive. It is no longer the agent-default public entry for non-trivial model
creation. The sections below are route layers for UI, structure, testing,
hierarchy, process, release, or evidence risk.

## Agent-Default API

`AGENT_DEFAULT_API` is the smallest public first-read surface for AI agents.
It keeps the normal path short:

- formal model-first entry: `RiskIntent`, `RiskProfile`,
  `FlowGuardCheckPlan`, `MinimumModelContract`, `KnownBadProof`, and
  `run_model_first_checks`;
- core modeling primitives: `Workflow`, `Invariant`, and `FunctionResult`;
- route selection: `FLOWGUARD_ROUTE_API`,
  `default_flowguard_route_profiles()`;
- FlowGuard self-maintenance:
  `default_flowguard_self_maintenance_plan()`,
  `review_flowguard_self_maintenance()`;
- project and release gates: `audit_project_adoption()`,
  `review_development_process_flow()`; the process simulator and maintenance
  scan helpers are consumed through DevelopmentProcessFlow rather than exposed
  as first-read gates;
- escalation checks: `review_model_test_alignment()`,
  `review_field_lifecycle()`, and `review_topology_hazards()`.

Use this group before expanding to `FLOWGUARD_ROUTE_API` or the complete
`MODELING_HELPER_API` inventory.

## Portable System Verification API

`API_SURFACE["portable_verification"]` also exposes the bounded system
composition cohort: `PortableSystemDefinition`, `SystemCompositionRequest`,
`PortableSystemSlice`, `SystemComponent`, `SystemDependency`, `SystemPort`,
`SystemBinding`, `SystemResource`, `SystemStep`, `SystemInteractionPattern`,
`SystemProperty`, `SystemCompositionReport`, `derive_system_slice()`, and
`check_portable_system()`.

Use these names when the verification subject is a declared finite subsystem
rather than one portable component. The system definition, request, and slice
have separate canonical fingerprints. The checker validates and compiles the
exact declared dependency closure, produces one stage-aware report, and never
claims coverage of undeclared or unknown components. The command-line surface
is `python -m flowguard portable-system-check`.

## Model System Authority API

`MODEL_SYSTEM_AUTHORITY_API` is the small public authority surface for an
existing modeled project. FlowGuard itself is implemented as a Python runtime,
but this authority model can describe software, services, workflows, agents,
pipelines, and mixed systems in any implementation language. A target-specific
provider supplies observation and native evidence; it does not change the
authority contract.

The stable current-intent cohort is `CurrentEffectiveIntentView`,
`EffectiveIntentTransition`, `EffectiveIntentOwnerBinding`,
`EffectiveIntentBootstrapReceipt`, `LegacyIntentBootstrapDisposition`,
`build_current_intent_bootstrap_receipt()`,
`bootstrap_current_effective_intent_view()`,
`build_current_effective_intent_view()`,
`validate_current_effective_intent_view()`,
`validate_current_effective_intent_refinement()`, and
`load_current_accepted_revision_set()`. The stable read-only planning cohort is
`ModelRevisionPlan` and `preview_current_model_revision()`.

The remaining authority cohort includes `ModelSystemSnapshot`,
`ModelInstanceRef`, `ModelAuthorityHead`, `CoverageUniverse`,
`ModelRevisionSet`, `build_model_instance_ref()`,
`build_manifest_model_system_snapshot()`, `audit_model_authority()`,
`load_observed_model_system()`, `bootstrap_model_authority()`,
`build_current_model_revision()`, `activate_model_revision_set()`, and
`rollback_observed_model_system()`.

Use this cohort to distinguish the one observed implementation snapshot from
normative targets and counterfactual experiments. The observed head is a
durable content-addressed project pointer, not a filename or mutable label.
Target/experiment work stays isolated until one exact whole revision set
passes affected-closure and evidence checks and is activated pointer-last
under the shared project-manifest lock. Operational rollback restores or
compensates implementation effects before moving authority.

Each revision keeps two different intent records. Its revision-local delta
says what this revision adds, replaces, or retires. Its cumulative
`CurrentEffectiveIntentView` says what the complete modeled system currently
means after that delta. The current view must bind every independently derived
current model owner exactly once, reverify every active intent source, and
record each prior contribution as retained, superseded, or retired. The first
v5 current view uses one explicit, ancestry-audited bootstrap receipt; later
revisions refine that accepted view directly. Historical revision deltas are
evidence about how the system changed, not a substitute current view.

`build_current_model_revision()` accepts only one current-schema terminal-pass
full model-regression parent receipt whose exact child receipts independently
verify against the current manifest, inputs, obligations, toolchain, and
environment. It derives the canonical diff and affected closure, writes one
content-addressed candidate/revision pair, and never activates authority. The
corresponding thin command-line surfaces are
`model-system-bootstrap`, `model-revision-intent-bootstrap`,
`model-system-audit`,
`model-revision-plan`, `model-revision-owner-evidence`,
`model-revision-build`, `model-revision-activate`, and
`model-revision-rollback`. These are two separate bootstrap boundaries:
`model-system-bootstrap` establishes generation-one observed authority for a
new modeled project, while `model-revision-intent-bootstrap` moves an existing
generation-one or legacy v4 lineage into its first cumulative v5 intent view.
Ordinary accepted v5 changes use build, refinement validation, and activation.
These commands preserve the
existing ModelMesh, preflight, behavior-commitment, field-lifecycle,
model-test-alignment, TestMesh, and DevelopmentProcessFlow ownership; this API
does not create another modeling route.

## Whole-Target DNA Completion Gate

`DNA_COMPLETION_GATE_API` is the outer claim projection for a product-level
DNA statement. It is intentionally stricter than the provider-neutral
blueprint qualifier. `DnaCompletionAssessment` names the seventeen current
layers: static blueprint, semantic model, intent inventory, observed
implementation surface, bidirectional traceability, behavior binding, code
binding, static test binding, runtime test execution, contract universe, real
UI surface, external consumer, fault matrix, platform/provider, installation,
observed-miss backfeed, and release identity.

Each `DnaCompletionLayerEvidence` row must name its native owner, exact input
fingerprint, terminal evidence id/fingerprint, evidence kind, and claim
boundary. `review_dna_completion()` preserves `not_run`, stale, skipped,
not-applicable, self-reported, and unverified rows as blockers. The gate does
not run pytest, browsers, installers, external consumers, or platform/fault
experiments; those native owners must produce the evidence it consumes.
Static blueprint readiness or a passing parent summary therefore cannot by
itself produce `dna_complete`. A scoped assessment can be current for its
declared boundary, but only the complete broad layer set can license the
aggregate DNA claim.

`scripts/assemble_dna_completion_assessment.py` is a read-only evidence
assembler for the outer gate. It reads native inventory, consumer, and test
artifacts, preserves every missing/stale/not-run layer, and intentionally
returns a non-zero process status while a broad assessment is blocked. It
does not execute tests, launch a UI, install a package, or manufacture proof.

`FAULT_MATRIX_EVIDENCE_API` is the read-only leaf reconciler for the fault
lane. It requires an independently generated finite case denominator,
root-cause and user-visible outcome fields, terminal and recovery results, and
content-addressed producer receipts for executed rows. A matrix count,
synthetic fault profile, caller-supplied hash prefix, or summary status cannot
authorize a fault claim. The CLI equivalent is
`python -m flowguard fault-matrix-review --matrix <artifact.json>`.

## Independent Behavior Discovery Owner

`scripts/discover_behavior_inventory.py` is the native discovery boundary for
an explicit behavior denominator. It consumes a versioned manifest whose
expected ids, semantic rows, source references, and claim boundary are
authored by the discovery owner. It computes current source-file fingerprints,
materializes the existing `BehaviorInventory` schema, and runs
`review_independent_behavior_inventory()`.

The command never scans BCL rows, tests, model files, or package exports to
guess behavior. It rejects test/BCL source paths, missing or unexpected ids,
and source anchors that do not match the declared file. Its output is a
fingerprinted discovery evidence artifact; a passing scoped inventory is not a
whole-product behavior denominator and does not turn on the canonical BCL
`require_complete_behavior_inventory` flag by itself.

Example:

```powershell
python scripts/discover_behavior_inventory.py `
  --root . `
  --manifest docs/flowguard_behavior_inventory_manifest.json `
  --output .flowguard/behavior/inventory/behavior_inventory_evidence.json
```

## Understanding Readiness Projection

`UNDERSTANDING_READINESS_API` is a read-only projection inside the existing
`model_first_function_flow` route. `UnderstandingReadinessInput`,
`UnderstandingReadinessStatus`, and `compose_understanding_status()` consume
explicit task facts, model identity, coverage demand, canonical owner
resolutions, maturation report, independent receipt verification, admission,
and user choice. They report three independent values: understanding
sufficiency, user execution choice, and FlowGuard implementation admission.

The matching `model-understanding-status` CLI accepts explicit JSON paths. The
API and command do not execute an owner, verify a receipt, resume a run,
publish evidence, switch model authority, or write files. Missing inputs remain
`not_run` or `unresolved`; mismatched current identities become `stale`; direct
user execution never upgrades understanding or FlowGuard admission. This is a
facade over the existing task-coverage, maturation, receipt, and process
owners, not a new public route or skill.

## Governance And Distribution API

`FLOWGUARD_GOVERNANCE_API` groups the release-facing control plane, including
local/published release verification, without
turning it into another modeling route. It exposes immutable evidence receipts,
manifest-declared suite inventory and contract compilation, receipt-bound self
governance, canonical validation results, manifest-owned model regressions, and
safe skill install/check/uninstall/parity helpers. Import route behavior from
the owning route group; use this group to verify that current route evidence is
complete, fresh, consumed, and synchronized.

## Route Starter API

`ROUTE_STARTER_API` is the default second step after `AGENT_DEFAULT_API`.
It maps route ids to compact helper names, usually one plan/report shape, one
review function, and one template factory. These are the names an AI agent
should read before opening a full route group.

Use the layers in this order:

```text
AGENT_DEFAULT_API
-> ROUTE_STARTER_API[route_id]
-> ROUTE_ADVANCED_API[route_id]
-> MODELING_HELPER_API / REPORTING_HELPER_API as full indexes only
```

`FLOWGUARD_ROUTE_API` and `ROUTE_STARTER_API` are public-owner surfaces. Internal
feeders, delegated modes, and data helpers stay out of the first-read route
map. `FLOWGUARD_INTERNAL_ROUTE_API` and `ROUTE_ADVANCED_API` keep the full route
groups available for deep work.
`PLAN_INTAKE_STARTER_API` is the compact first-read slice for plan-intake claim
review; `PLAN_INTAKE_ADVANCED_API` remains the complete plan-intake inventory.

`behavior_commitment_ledger` is the upstream public route for broad behavior
claims. Use `ROUTE_STARTER_API["behavior_commitment_ledger"]` before claiming a
project, release, UI/API/CLI behavior, skill, workflow, or process boundary is
covered. Path-sensitive commitments then hand off to
`primary_path_authority`. `BEHAVIOR_COMMITMENT_LOOKUP_API` extends those same
owners with plane-first read-only lookup (`BehaviorLookupQuery`,
`BehaviorCommitmentHit`, `BehaviorLookupReport`,
`query_behavior_commitments()`, and
`query_behavior_commitments_from_path()`) rather than adding a route. The BCL
surface also exports `BehaviorLookupBinding`, `BehaviorCommitmentRelation`,
plane/actor/relation/role constants, canonical ledger load/write helpers, and
the ledger fingerprint. `audit_behavior_commitment_source_inventory()` is the
read-only current-file gate; `refresh_behavior_commitment_source_inventory()`
is its pure, no-write physical-identity refresh. Direct, anchored,
semicolon-composite, and fixed-directory-prefixed glob refs share one canonical
newline-aware file identity and one versioned physical aggregate instead of
trusting stored `freshness_state`; unsafe, prefix-free, empty, missing-anchor,
and duplicate-member refs fail visibly. Authored ownership and declared
semantics remain outside that physical aggregate. Exact external purposes keep one stable
`business_intent_id`, one active commitment, and one singular
`primary_path_id`; repeated UI/API/CLI/adapter surfaces delegate to that
authority.

The three canonical plane values are `product_runtime`, `agent_operation`, and
`development_process`. Existing Model Preflight reports primary, related, and
ambiguous candidate hits separately with lookup status and ledger fingerprint;
typed related context cannot become a primary owner. The matching read-only CLI
is:

```powershell
python -m flowguard behavior-commitment-query "start the UI test and check the port bridge" --root . --plane agent_operation --term port_bridge --json
```

The command explains recall; it does not execute a commitment, create a route,
force every ordinary action to run a model, or guarantee future AI behavior.

Template defaults follow the same rule. `model-miss-template`,
`model-test-alignment-template`, and `ui-flow-structure-template` emit compact
runnable scaffolds. Use `model-miss-full-template`,
`model-test-alignment-full-template`, or `ui-flow-structure-full-template` only
when the route needs the deep example.

## Core API

Core APIs are the stable objects used by the formal runner and advanced custom
checks:

- `FunctionBlock`, `FunctionResult`
- `Invariant`, `InvariantResult`
- `Workflow`, `WorkflowPath`, `WorkflowRun`
- `ReachabilityCondition`, `enumerate_input_sequences`
- `CheckReport`, `InvariantViolation`, `DeadBranch`, `ExceptionBranch`,
  `ReachabilityFailure`
- `Trace`, `TraceStep`

These APIs should stay small and semantically stable. New helpers should not
change the meaning of `FunctionBlock` or `Workflow`, and obsolete
compatibility-only aliases should not remain in the first-read surface.
FlowGuard is current-schema-only: old artifacts may be detected at project/tool
boundaries, but they are rejected rather than upgraded, migrated, or accepted
through a compatibility reader. The maintaining agent must directly rewrite
the current model/source and then regenerate current tests and receipts before
normal route logic can consume the artifact.

Formal runs emit minimal progress visibility by default through the internal
finite runner: a start line and bounded progress lines on `stderr`, counted by
top-level `initial_state x input_sequence` work units. This is observability
only; it does not change reports, traces, pass/fail status, or stdout output.
Use `FLOWGUARD_PROGRESS=0` for silent formal runs.

## Route-Scoped Discovery First

For AI agents, route groups are the normal discovery surface:

- `FLOWGUARD_ROUTE_API` names the public owner route groups. Delegated modes,
  internal feeders, and data helpers are listed in `FLOWGUARD_INTERNAL_ROUTE_API`
  and can be consumed only through their owner route or advanced helper
  inventory.
- `default_flowguard_route_profiles()` is the compact first-read map for AI
  maintenance: each `RouteProfile` names the trigger, minimal inputs, outputs,
  evidence owner, API group, template, skill, role, entry policy, owner route,
  absorption route, cleanup disposition, and next actions. Use
  `review_flowguard_self_maintenance()` to check that public owner profiles stay
  aligned with public route groups and that internal helpers do not leak into
  `FLOWGUARD_ROUTE_API`.
  When a route gains a new contract object, generated case family, evidence
  receipt, or downstream gate, update its route profile in the same change; the
  profile is the AI-facing checklist after route selection. Keep
  `ROUTE_STARTER_API` compact and put detailed checklists in route profiles,
  advanced APIs, docs, and skills.
- `default_ai_maintenance_profiles()` gives thin entry profiles for common
  FlowGuard self-maintenance work such as fields, route graph connection,
  structure, and validation. They are entry profiles only; route-owned evidence
  still expands in the specialist route.
- `PLAN_DETAILING_ROUTE_API` is a delegated DevelopmentProcessFlow mode helper
  for vague ideas, short plans, and AI-generated outlines that need explicit
  source, scope, state, side effect, step, receipt, validation, rework,
  human-question, and claim rows.
- `CanonicalRelation` and `CanonicalRelationHandoff` are internal direct-current
  carriers for exact DNA/BCL/topology edges that an existing owner has already
  declared. They do not form a route, search for related code, infer scope, or
  make a completion decision.
- `CODE_STRUCTURE_RECOMMENDATION_ROUTE_API`,
  `MODEL_TEST_ALIGNMENT_ROUTE_API`, and `ARCHITECTURE_REDUCTION_ROUTE_API`
  consume `CanonicalRelationHandoff` when an exact declared relation affects
  their work.
  `MODEL_TEST_ALIGNMENT_ROUTE_API` also exposes transition coverage matrix
  helpers for turning modeled transitions into direct test-evidence
  obligations. Python source-audit execution lives in
  `flowguard.model_test_alignment_source`, while the original
  `flowguard.model_test_alignment` and top-level `flowguard` imports remain
  compatibility facades.
- `MAINTENANCE_OBLIGATION_MEMORY_API` is the shared memory object used by
  summary reports, DevelopmentProcessFlow, ModelMaturation, and Risk Evidence
  Ledger so unresolved gaps remain attached to their existing owner instead of
  becoming a separate scan or debt authority.
- `RISK_TEMPLATE_LIBRARY_API` is the single public/local reusable risk-template
  route. It runs only for an explicit reuse/publication request or current
  executable evidence of a bounded stable pattern intended for use outside the
  target project. Once triggered, it strictly searches packaged and portable
  per-machine local templates, records exact reuse or reviewed no-match, and
  closes template harvest before that template operation is complete. Ordinary
  modeling, repair, maintenance, cleanup, and release do not inherit this gate.
- `FIELD_LIFECYCLE_MESH_API` is the field-governance layer for changes where
  fields carry behavior, routing, permissions, schema, replay, migration, or
  external-contract meaning. High-level models project important fields into
  obligations and code contracts; leaf field groups account for every
  discovered field, including display-only fields with scoped-out reasons and
  old/replaced/deprecated fields with closing disposition evidence.
- `STATE_CLOSURE_ROUTE_API` is the default runner gate for finite input/state
  enumerations that may have unknown, malformed, missing, or old-schema cases.
- `TOPOLOGY_HAZARD_ROUTE_API` is the default runner review for model-shape
  future-use hazards before broad done, release, publish, or full-confidence
  claims. It includes `BusinessPathIdentity` so important routes can name the
  useful business path they prove, not only the local model node that ran.
- `FLOWGUARD_SELF_MAINTENANCE_ROUTE_API` is the parent route for FlowGuard's
  own maintenance chain: route graph completeness, AI entry profiles, field
  layers, child route reports, install/shadow sync, and closure boundaries.

Use `MODELING_HELPER_API` only as the complete index after the route group is
known. It is intentionally broad and is not first-read guidance.

## Modeling Helpers

Modeling helpers reduce boilerplate around common bug classes. Prefer the
route-scoped groups above when choosing an AI workflow; this section is the full
inventory.

- property factories such as `no_duplicate_by`, `at_most_once_by`,
  `cache_matches_source`, `require_label_order`, and `forbid_label_after`;
- state write inventory guidance for fields named by invariants;
- public starter templates for basic models, Risk Intent check plans,
  risk-template library use, model-miss reviews, closure-contract reviews, and
  recurring maintenance workflows;
- route-scoped risk template helpers such as `search_risk_templates()`,
  `review_minimum_model_contract()`, `harvest_risk_template_candidate()`,
  `TemplateHarvestReview`, and `review_template_harvest_closure()`; these are
  strict after the conditional template route is admitted, not universal model
  completion gates;
- scenario review and `ScenarioMatrixBuilder`;
- deterministic counterexample minimization;
- optional domain packs such as `DeduplicationPack`, `CachePack`, `RetryPack`,
  and `SideEffectPack`;
- optional loop, progress, contract, conformance, and replay helpers.
- default state/input closure helpers such as `StateClosurePlan`,
  `StateClosureDimension`, `infer_state_closure_plan()`, and
  `review_state_closure()` for keeping unknown/other cases visible in
  `run_model_first_checks(...)` without changing formal model semantics.
- contract-exhaustion helpers such as `ContractDimension`, `ContractAxis`,
  `ContractInteractionGroup`, `ContractMutationCase`,
  `ContractCombinationCase`, `ContractCoverageShard`,
  `ContractCoverageUniverse`, `ContractCoverageExclusion`,
  `ModelContractCoverageReceipt`, `ContractOracle`,
  `CompositeHandoffAcceptance`, `ContractFaultProfile`,
  `ObservedProblemBackfeed`, `ObservedProblemBackfeedReport`,
  `ContractExhaustionPlan`,
  `ContractExhaustionReport`,
  `review_contract_exhaustion()`,
  `contract_fault_profiles_from_report()`,
  `review_observed_problem_backfeed()`,
  `state_closure_cases_to_contract_cases()`,
  `scenario_matrix_to_contract_cases()`,
  `family_bad_case_seed_to_contract_cases()`,
  `artifact_payload_cases_to_contract_cases()`,
  `transition_coverage_to_contract_cases()`,
  `model_mesh_closure_to_contract_cases()`,
  `contract_exhaustion_to_model_obligations()`,
  `contract_exhaustion_to_test_mesh_cell_ids()`,
  `contract_exhaustion_to_test_mesh_shard_ids()`,
  `contract_exhaustion_to_coverage_receipt_ids()`, and
  `contract_exhaustion_to_risk_gate_ids()` plus
  `contract_exhaustion_to_composite_handoff_acceptance_ids()` for turning declared finite
  boundaries, model-scoped Cartesian axes, same-class family seeds, payload
  cases, transition cells, and parent/child closure hazards into canonical
  bad-case ids with explicit oracle expectations, coverage receipts,
  downstream route handoffs, shard evidence targets, generic synthetic
  contract-fault profiles, observed-problem backfeed, and independent
  composite handoff acceptance ids. Matrix ready does not mean whole-chain
  ready, and broad/full coverage needs a declared coverage universe rather
  than only internally consistent generated cases.
- default model topology hazard helpers such as `UsageIntent`,
  `TopologyDigest`, `TopologyHazardCandidate`,
  `infer_topology_digest()`, `infer_topology_hazard_plan()`, and
  `review_topology_hazards()` for grounding future-use risk review in concrete
  model topology anchors.
- optional budgeted model-group helpers such as `BudgetedGraphConfig` and
  `run_budgeted_graph_checks()` for large reachable graph models that need
  shard-by-shard execution with a durable ledger.
- optional hierarchical mesh helpers such as `HierarchyPartitionMap`,
  `ModelTargetSplitDerivation`, `ChildModelEvidence`,
  `ChildReattachmentContract`, `ChildBoundaryChangeSummary`,
  `MeshClosureModel`, `MeshClosureTransition`, `MeshClosureJoin`,
  `MeshClosureTerminal`, `review_mesh_closure_model()`,
  `summarize_child_boundary_change()`, `review_hierarchical_mesh()`,
  `LegacyModelRecord`, and `classify_legacy_model()` for reviewing
  model-derived target child layouts, parent/child partition coverage, repaired
  child reattachment, child boundary propagation, affected sibling review,
  whole-flow closure across model handoffs, bug-class responsibility
  separation, large-model split triggers, and legacy compatibility.
- optional automatic model/test split helpers such as `AutoSplitCandidate`,
  `AutoSplitPolicy`, `AutoSplitPlan`, `AutoSplitReport`, and
  `review_auto_mesh_splits()` for turning oversized, incomplete, slow, broad,
  progress-only, or release-only direct evidence into a required ModelMesh or
  TestMesh split gate before parent confidence is claimed.
- optional layered boundary proof helpers such as `ParentCoverageItem`,
  `ChildProofContract`, `ChildReattachmentProof`, `LeafBoundaryMatrix`,
  `LeafBoundaryMatrixCell`, `LayeredBoundaryProofPlan`, and
  `review_layered_boundary_proof()` for joining parent coverage, child
  disjointness, child reattachment, and leaf
  `Input x State -> Set(Output x State)` boundary-matrix evidence into one
  parent confidence gate.
- optional closure-contract helpers such as `FlowGuardClosureContractPlan`,
  `ClosureEvidenceReport`, `RuntimeTraceMapping`, `ArtifactInvalidation`,
  `ModelQualitySignal`, `SameClassMissClosure`,
  `RuntimeGatewayInventoryClosure`, and
  `review_flowguard_closure_contract()` for consuming current route evidence
  before broad done, release, publish, or production-confidence claims.
- optional architecture reduction helpers such as
  `ObservableArchitectureContract`, `CompatibilitySurfaceClassification`,
  `ArchitectureReductionCandidate`, `ArchitectureReductionTrigger`,
  `TargetArchitectureAction`,
  `ArchitectureReductionPlan`, `ArchitectureReductionReport`,
  `ArchitectureReductionStepAssessment`, `ArchitectureReductionStepCost`, and
  `review_architecture_reduction()` for reviewing whether an existing modeled
  implementation can be contracted without changing declared observable
  behavior, classifying compatibility surfaces such as old aliases, migration
  paths, public facades, retired rejection tests, and archive-only evidence,
  classifying merge/collapse/remove/keep-facade candidates, keeping completed
  or historical candidates out of the active ready queue, and handing target
  structure actions to Code Structure Recommendation or StructureMesh before
  production code is edited. Retained routes are also reviewed internally:
  each modeled step is classified as `retain`, `merge`, `delegate`, `remove`,
  `explicit_on_demand`, or `unresolved` from the same caller and responsibility
  inventory. Operation, invocation, payload-byte, and estimated-token measures
  order the review queue only; they never replace equivalence, replacement,
  trigger, or safety/evidence-owner proof.
- internal canonical-relation carrier helpers: `CanonicalRelation`,
  `CanonicalRelationHandoff`, the current relation-type constants, and
  `normalize_canonical_relation_handoff()`. A route owner supplies exact
  relation ids, typed endpoints, and source identities; ContractExhaustionMesh
  can materialize finite relation cases. These helpers do not compare arbitrary
  pairs, discover affected scope, select ownership, or prove a code change.
- model-test alignment helpers such as `ModelObligation`,
  `ClosureEvidenceTarget`, `CodeContract`, `TestEvidence`,
  `ModelTestAlignmentPlan`, and `review_model_test_alignment()` for directly
  comparing model obligations with owner code external contracts and ordinary
  test evidence without invoking TestMesh or StructureMesh. `ModelCodeTestBindingRow`
  exposes the required behavior closure row: owner contracts, paths, symbols,
  tests, boundary/runtime/payload ids, source-audit decision, and open gap
  codes. `TestEvidence` can distinguish primary proof, primary `edge_path`
  proof, supporting contract evidence, integration smoke evidence, exact leaf
  matrix-cell evidence, transition-cell evidence, and model-miss closure roles
  such as observed regression, same-class generalized evidence,
  `counterexample_regression`, and `known_bad_replay`. `ClosureEvidenceTarget`
  binds a concrete counterexample id, known-bad proof id, or replay case id to
  the external owner-code test that must close it. `TransitionCoverageCell`,
  `TransitionCoverageMatrix`, `transition_coverage_to_model_obligations()`,
  `transition_coverage_to_code_contracts()`,
  `transition_coverage_to_required_leaf_cell_ids()`,
  `transition_obligation_id()`, and
  `ui_interaction_model_to_transition_coverage()` provide the standard bridge
  from modeled transitions into those alignment and TestMesh evidence targets.
  `model_mesh_closure_to_transition_coverage()` does the same for ModelMesh
  closure transitions, with `MODEL_MESH_CLOSURE_RETRY_TEST_KINDS` enforcing
  retry/rejection evidence breadth for repeated-input handoffs.
  Field lifecycle reports and projections can be supplied directly to
  `ModelTestAlignmentPlan`, where behavior-bearing fields become model
  obligations and code contracts that still require current test evidence.
  `ArtifactPayloadContract`, `ArtifactPayloadCase`,
  `ArtifactPayloadEvidence`, and `review_artifact_payload_validation()` add the
  same evidence gate for import/export files, generated artifacts, saved/load
  payloads, and AI work packages: current external case evidence must prove
  that synthetic payload cases exercised the real payload surface, with an
  evidence reference or proof artifact for expected status, output, error path,
  state writes, side effects, and round-trip behavior before broad payload
  claims are green.
- field lifecycle helpers such as `FieldLifecyclePlan`,
  `FieldLifecycleGroup`, `FieldLifecycleRow`, `FieldProjection`,
  `FieldLifecycleReport`, `review_field_lifecycle()`,
  `field_lifecycle_to_model_obligations()`, and
  `field_lifecycle_to_code_contracts()` for keeping field ownership,
  reader/writer maps, lifecycle state, behavior projection, scoped-out
  reasons, old-field disposition, and broad-claim gate/test/replay route refs
  visible before code or done claims.
- optional obligation-family parity helpers such as `ObligationFamily`,
  `ObligationFamilyMember`, `ObligationFamilyEvidence`,
  `FamilyBadCaseSeed`, `derive_same_class_bad_cases()`, and
  `review_obligation_family_parity()` for checking that related obligations
  have the same required mechanism coverage from allowed provenance sources
  before a family-level claim is promoted to full confidence. For bug-repair
  workflows, the owner must declare the finite affected relations and route
  them through ContractExhaustionMesh so every required sibling case has a
  stable id, oracle, and MTA/TestMesh/Risk Ledger handoff. Obligation-family
  parity may check an already-declared shared claim; it does not discover the
  family or expand scope.
- optional model maturation helpers such as `TaskFacts`,
  `TaskCoverageDemand`, `ModelMaturationSignal`, `ModelMaturationPlan`,
  `ModelMaturationIteration`, `ModelMaturationReport`,
  `ModelMaturationSession`, `compile_task_coverage_demand()`,
  `review_model_maturation_loop()`, and `review_model_maturation_session()` for turning model-miss, model-test,
  ModelMesh, code-boundary, and freshness signals into task-bound prediction,
  falsifier, exact native-receipt, gap-continuity, and terminal evidence before
  a broad FlowGuard claim is made. `ModelMaturationReceiptRef` and
  `verify_model_maturation_receipt()` keep receipt publication separate from
  independent currentness verification; raw mappings do not carry authority.
- optional FlowGuard self-maintenance helpers such as `RouteProfile`,
  `AIMaintenanceProfile`, `FieldLayerProfile`,
  `SelfMaintenanceChildReport`, `SelfMaintenancePlan`,
  `default_flowguard_self_maintenance_plan()`,
  `default_flowguard_route_profiles()`,
  `default_ai_maintenance_profiles()`, `default_field_layer_profiles()`,
  `route_graph_completeness_findings()`, and
  `review_flowguard_self_maintenance()` for keeping FlowGuard's own AI-facing
  maintenance path route-first. These helpers make fields and evidence lighter
  at first read, but they do not delete behavior-bearing fields or replace
  Model-Test Alignment, StructureMesh, TestMesh, DevelopmentProcessFlow, Risk
  Evidence Ledger, or Closure Contract.
- optional conservative Python source-audit helpers such as
  `PythonCodeContractEvidence`, `PythonTestAssertionEvidence`,
  `ContractSourceAuditReport`, `audit_python_code_contracts()`,
  `audit_python_test_assertions()`, and
  `review_python_contract_source_audit()` for feeding AST-visible code and test
  assertion evidence into Model-Test Alignment without presenting it as perfect
  semantic proof or a replacement for conformance replay. When
  `ModelTestAlignmentPlan.require_source_audit` is true, attached
  `ContractSourceAuditReport` rows must be green and cover the plan's required
  code contracts and tests before the final alignment decision can be green.
- optional code-boundary conformance helpers such as
  `CodeBoundaryContract`, `CodeBoundaryObservation`,
  `CodeBoundaryConformanceReport`, and
  `review_code_boundary_conformance()` for checking whether real code
  observations stay inside a model-declared finite input/output boundary before
  alignment confidence is claimed.
- optional runtime gateway adoption helpers such as
  `RuntimeStateSurface`, `RuntimeGatewayContract`,
  `RuntimeWriteObservation`, `RuntimeWriterInventoryEvidence`,
  `RuntimeGatewayAdoptionPlan`,
  `RuntimeGatewayAdoptionReport`, and
  `review_runtime_gateway_adoption()` for distinguishing design-only,
  test-aligned, and runtime-gateway FlowGuard adoption, and for blocking
  runtime protection claims when critical state writes can still bypass the
  declared gateway. `RuntimeWriterInventoryEvidence` makes the writer scan
  auditable by listing covered critical surfaces, discovered writers,
  scoped-out writers with reasons, current passing status, and proof artifacts.
- optional runtime path evidence helpers such as `RuntimeNodeContract`,
  `RuntimeNodeObservation`, `RuntimePathRecorder`, and
  `review_runtime_path_alignment()` for comparing real code progress output to
  named FlowGuard model nodes. These helpers live in `MODELING_HELPER_API`, not
  `CORE_API`, and progress lines should include `model_id`, `model_path`, and
  `node_id`.
- optional TestMesh helpers such as `TestMeshPlan`, `TestPartitionItem`,
  `TestTargetSplitDerivation`, `TestSuiteEvidence`, and `review_test_mesh()`
  for reviewing model-derived target suite/script layouts, parent/child test
  hierarchy coverage, child suite/script ownership, evidence freshness,
  background completion, exact leaf matrix-cell evidence ownership, and
  routine-vs-release validation confidence.
- optional StructureMesh helpers such as `StructureMeshPlan`,
  `StructurePartitionItem`, `ModuleStructureEvidence`,
  `PublicEntrypointEvidence`, and `review_structure_mesh()` for reviewing large
  script or module splits, child ownership, public entrypoint compatibility,
  facades, dependency cycles, config drift, behavior parity, and
  routine-vs-release refactor confidence.
- optional Code Structure Recommendation helpers such as
  `CodeStructureRecommendation`, `TargetModuleRecommendation`, and
  `review_code_structure_recommendation()` for recommending implementation
  structure from a FlowGuard functional model before code is written. The
  recommendation surface includes field owner, reader, and writer maps so
  fields do not disappear during module splitting or function movement.
- optional Existing Model Preflight helpers such as `ExistingModelPreflight`,
  `ModelContextHit`, `ExistingOwnershipSnapshot`, `DuplicateBoundaryRisk`, and
  `review_existing_model_preflight()` for grounding discussion, proposal, or
  implementation work in current FlowGuard model ownership before creating a
  new boundary. Full preflight records layered proof evidence id, parent
  coverage, child disjointness, child reattachment, leaf boundary-matrix
  status for parent models with child models, and optional canonical relation
  evidence when current DNA/BCL/topology identities already establish an
  affected sibling, shared owner/mechanism, duplicate boundary, adapter-only
  edge, or false friend. For field-bearing changes it
  also records behavior field ids, field owners, existing field lifecycle
  model ids, and unresolved field lifecycle gaps before downstream work starts.
- optional UI Flow Structure helpers such as `UIContentVisibilityItem`,
  `UIContentVisibilityPlan`, `UIContentVisibilityEvidence`,
  `UIContentVisibilityReport`, `UI_CONTENT_VISIBILITY_CLASSES`,
  `UIProductConsistencyRule`, `UIProductSurface`,
  `UIProductConsistencyObservation`, `UIProductConsistencyException`,
  `UIProductConsistencyPlan`, `UIProductConsistencyReport`,
  `UIProductLanguageCaseSeed`,
  `UI_CONTENT_NEED_KINDS`, `UI_CONTENT_VISIBILITY_EVIDENCE_KINDS`, `UIInteractionModel`,
  `UIControl`, `UIDisplayElement`, `UIStateNode`, `UITransition`,
  `UIObservedSurfaceItem`, `UIObservedSurfaceInventory`,
  `UIControlFunctionalChain`, `UIControlFunctionalChainSet`,
  `UIWorkModeDeclaration`, `UISourceBaseline`, `UISourceBaselineItem`,
  `UISourceTargetMapping`, `UISourceTargetMappingRow`,
  `UIObservedSourceAlignment`, `UISourceInteractionSemantics`,
  `UISourceBaselineInteractionGate`,
  `UIFunctionalCapability`, `UIFunctionalCapabilityInventory`,
  `UICapabilityOutputContract`, `UICapabilityCoverageBinding`,
  `UIFunctionalCapabilityCoverageReport`,
  `UIJourneyCoverage`, `UIJourneyEntryPoint`, `UIFeatureJourney`,
  `UITerminalActionAllowance`, `UIBlindspot`,
  `UIJourneyCoverageReport`, `UIFeatureContract`,
  `UIImplementationJourneyRun`, `UIImplementationStepEvidence`,
  `UIImplementationValidation`,
  `UIImplementationValidationReport`,
  `UIUserTaskFrame`, `UIUserTaskCoverageLedger`,
  `UIRegionSemanticMap`, `UIAffordanceContract`, `UIActionGrammar`,
  `UIDialogWindowContract`, `UIKeyboardFocusContract`,
  `UIHumanWalkthroughStep`, `UIHumanWalkthroughScenario`,
  `UIHumanOperabilityAssessment`, `UIHumanOperabilityReport`,
  `UIVisibleSurface`, `UIVisibleSurfaceItem`, `UIVisibleSurfaceReport`,
  `UIRenderEvidence`, `UIRenderEvidenceSet`, `UIRenderEvidenceReport`,
  `UIGeometryLayoutEvidence`, `UIGeometryLayoutEvidenceSet`,
  `UIGeometryLayoutEvidenceReport`, `UIHotPathAction`, `UIColdPathWork`,
  `UIStableRegionRule`, `UIResponsivenessContract`,
  `UIResponsivenessContractReport`,
  `UIStructureDerivation`, `UIRegionRecommendation`,
  `UITextHierarchyBlueprint`, `UITextElement`, `UITypographyToken`,
  `review_ui_content_visibility()`,
  `review_ui_product_consistency()`,
  `default_ui_product_language_case_seeds()`,
  `ui_content_visibility_candidate_ids_from_field_lifecycle()`,
  `review_ui_observed_surface_inventory()`,
  `review_ui_control_functional_chains()`,
  `review_ui_source_baseline_alignment()`,
  `review_ui_source_baseline_interactions()`,
  `review_ui_functional_capability_coverage()`,
  `review_ui_interaction_model()`, `review_ui_journey_coverage()`,
  `review_ui_human_operability()`,
  `review_ui_implementation_validation()`,
  `review_ui_visible_surface()`, `review_ui_render_evidence()`,
  `review_ui_geometry_layout_evidence()`,
  `review_ui_responsiveness_contract()`,
  `review_ui_structure_derivation()`, and `review_ui_text_hierarchy()` for
  admitting UI-boundary content as `user_visible`, `user_on_demand`, or
  `internal` before display/text mapping, validating typed user needs and the
  narrow task-control-label exemption, inventorying the real visible UI
  without treating existing visibility as permission, modeling UI interactions, proving
  enabled-control functional chains, aligning source-baseline interactions when
  work is source-based or mixed,
  accounting required user-visible capabilities and result/output contracts
  before broad UI completion claims,
  proving launch-to-terminal journey coverage and reachable visible-control/event coverage when complete app UI is claimed,
  validating task coverage, region semantics, affordance, action grammar,
  native/dialog returns, keyboard/focus, all-target default-hidden behavior,
  task-owned affordance and content-specific feedback for on-demand details,
  structured per-content implementation evidence, and human walkthroughs before
  human-operable UI confidence is claimed,
  reviewing visible controls/helper/status/placeholder/metadata surface,
  validating implemented/runnable UI claims against feature contracts and real
  screenshot/browser/manual/DOM/geometry/accessibility/runtime/test evidence,
  checking universal geometry and responsiveness contracts, deriving
  parent/child UI topology, menu levels, stable placement, overlays, control
  hierarchy, information-display ownership, and then deriving semantic text
  hierarchy tokens with calm visual handoff guidance before visual design or
  frontend implementation. Product-scope consistency compares typography,
  component, navigation, interaction, feedback, recovery, and transition rules
  across every expected surface. Bounded exceptions are presentation-only;
  internal intent/commitment/path, audit, evidence, and diagnostic identities
  remain outside ordinary UI.
- development-process owner helpers such as
  `DevelopmentProcessSimulationRequest`,
  `DevelopmentProcessSimulatorReport`,
  `review_development_process_simulator()`, `ProcessArtifact`,
  `ProcessAction`, `ProcessEvidence`, `ValidationRequirement`,
  `DevelopmentProcessPlan`, `review_development_process_flow()`, and
  `derive_revalidation_plan()` for letting `development_process_flow` select
  `plan_detailing`, internal `strategy_selection`, `agent_workflow`, and
  `execution_freshness` modes, then
  reviewing lifecycle ordering, artifact overwrite, post-change owner scan
  signals, evidence freshness, and minimum revalidation without supervising
  ModelMesh, TestMesh, StructureMesh, or Model-Test Alignment. Field lifecycle
  artifacts, field projections, replacement disposition records, and
  bug-repair closure records have route-specific freshness codes so later
  writes cannot reuse stale field evidence.
  Conditional process optimization uses only
  `ProcessOptimizationContract`, `ProcessOptimizationCandidate`,
  `ProcessRepairGroup`, `ProcessOptimizationDecision`,
  `ProcessOptimizationReport`, and `review_process_optimization()` through
  this existing route group. There is intentionally no separate optimizer
  route, and ordinary work does not create these records.
  `ProcessAction.behavior_plane` stays `development_process`; its
  `target_behavior_planes`, `target_commitment_ids`, and
  `typed_commitment_relation_refs` identify product/agent targets without
  transferring their ownership. Background process evidence remains liveness
  until TestMesh has a terminal run id, status, exit/result artifacts,
  fingerprint, covered ids, inventory revision, and current versions.

These helpers return or consume the same core model objects. They are route
layers, not a new modeling language. For non-trivial model creation, the
formal `FlowGuardCheckPlan` path remains the required public entry.

## Reporting Helpers

Reporting helpers help an AI agent explain what was checked and what was not:

- `AssumptionCard` and `ConditionalAssumption` for visible bounded assumptions
  with explicit preconditions, a `why_not_modeled` explanation, invalidation
  conditions, rationale, and checks
- `RiskIntent`, `RiskProfile`, `FlowGuardCheckPlan`,
  `MinimumModelContract`, `KnownBadProof`, and `review_known_bad_proofs`
- route-scoped `TemplateReuseReview` and `TemplateHarvestReview` for an
  explicitly admitted `risk_template_library` operation
- `RiskEvidenceRow`, `RiskEvidenceProof`, `RiskEvidenceLedgerPlan`,
  `RiskEvidenceLedgerReport`, and `review_risk_evidence_ledger()` for the final
  confidence ledger that connects user risks to FlowGuard model obligations,
  optional public code contracts, finite ContractExhaustion coverage,
  independently verified ModelMaturation evidence, model/test split gates, UI
  implementation, real-surface, functional-chain, source-baseline interaction, and
  done-claim gates, artifact-payload gates, remembered owner-route maintenance
  obligations, and current proof evidence
- `MaintenanceObligation`, `MaintenanceObligationReport`, and
  `build_maintenance_obligation_report()` for preserving unresolved
  route-owned gaps as DevelopmentProcessFlow/ledger inputs without making them
  a separate discovery or skill route
- `ProofArtifactRef`, `proof_artifact_gap_codes()`, and proof-artifact status
  constants for binding declared evidence rows to concrete result paths,
  fingerprints, exit status, current route evidence, obligation coverage, and
  external-contract scope in strict confidence reviews
- `TestResultReuseTicket`, `coerce_test_result_reuse_ticket()`, and
  `test_result_reuse_gap_codes()` for proving that a previous test result can
  still count as current evidence when the command, test source, tested
  artifact, dependency, environment, result fingerprint, and coverage scope
  have not changed
- `ModelMaturationReceiptRef`, `VerifiedModelMaturation`,
  `verify_model_maturation_receipt()`, and
  `model_maturation_to_risk_evidence_gate()` for carrying the exact task-bound
  model-depth result into the final ledger without trusting raw mappings or
  self-declared status
- `LegacyPathDisposition` and `review_legacy_path_dispositions()` for blocking
  closure when an old route remains executable with an unknown, unproved, or
  out-of-scope-without-reason disposition
- plan-intake and typed claim helpers such as `PlanIntakeRiskSurface`,
  `PlanIntakeCompletenessPlan`, `review_plan_intake_completeness()`,
  `EvidenceAdapterMapping`, `review_evidence_adapter_conformance()`,
  `FalseNegativeCase`, `review_false_negative_backpropagation()`,
  `PlanMutationCase`, `review_plan_mutations()`,
  `FlowGuardClaimDependency`, and `review_flowguard_claim_chain()` for blocking
  under-declared plan inputs, lossy adapters, known false negatives,
  known-bad mutations, and unsupported promotion from narrow reports to broad
  confidence claims
- plan-detailing helpers such as `PlanDetail`, `PlanDetailStep`,
  `PlanDetailValidation`, `PlanDetailFailureBranch`,
  `review_plan_detail()`, `plan_detail_to_plan_intake()`,
  `plan_detail_to_step_contracts()`,
  `plan_detail_to_development_process()`, and
  `plan_detail_to_agent_workflow_plan()` for delegated `plan_detailing` mode
  row construction after the development-process simulator decides rough plans
  need checkable rows
- model-impact freshness helpers such as `ModelFreshnessRecord`,
  `UpgradeImpact`, `ModelImpactAssessment`, `ModelReuseTicket`,
  `ModelRerunEvidence`, `ModelImpactFreshnessPlan`,
  `ModelImpactFreshnessReport`, and `review_model_impact_freshness()` for
  classifying existing models after a FlowGuard upgrade, accepting current
  reuse tickets for unchanged models, and requiring current rerun evidence for
  affected models before broad upgrade freshness is claimed
- `run_model_first_checks`
- `audit_model`
- `FlowGuardSummaryReport`
- `FlowGuardFindingLedger`, `build_finding_ledger`, and summary-derived
  `maintenance_obligations` for flattening all section findings and
  skipped/not-run gaps before deciding or inheriting a repair path
- adoption logging and `audit_flowguard_adoption`
- thin adoption logging commands such as `adoption-start` and
  `adoption-finish`
- artifact/project upgrade helpers such as `ArtifactUpgradeReport`,
  `review_artifact_upgrades()`, and the audit-only `artifact-upgrade` command
  for detecting old FlowGuard artifacts and reporting a direct-current-rewrite
  blocker. They never apply migrations or add runtime compatibility branches.
- project adoption/version helpers such as `audit_project_adoption()`,
  `adopt_project()`, and `upgrade_project()` for writing the managed
  FlowGuard `AGENTS.md` block, `.flowguard/project.toml`, and adoption records
  in target repositories. Project upgrade audits older adopted repositories and
  stops on stale artifacts; the maintainer must rewrite current
  artifact/model/test/guidance directly. These helpers record FlowGuard's GitHub repository
  and package/schema versions; they do not replace executable model checks.
- schema, JSON artifact helpers, and explicit Mermaid source exporters for
  user-facing model explanations when a compact diagram helps clarify major
  states, branches, gates, evidence, and claim boundaries

Warnings, gaps, skipped sections, and `not_run` sections are confidence
boundaries. They should not be hidden, but they also should not be treated as
hard failures unless the underlying section actually failed.
Mermaid diagrams are explanation aids; they do not change pass/fail semantics
or replace executable validation evidence.

## Evidence And Internal Validation

Evidence APIs are used to keep FlowGuard itself honest:

- evidence baseline reports;
- lightweight evidence gates such as `EvidenceGate`,
  `summarize_evidence_gates()`, and `evidence_gates_from_process_like()` for
  grouping broad evidence fields without hiding skipped, stale, not-run, or
  progress-only states;
- benchmark scorecards and benchmark coverage audits;
- problem corpus and executable corpus reports;
- pytest/template helpers used by examples and framework validation;
- template writers, including public owner route templates and internal
  evidence scaffolds such as `model_test_alignment_template_files()`,
  `model_test_alignment_full_template_files()`,
  `code_structure_recommendation_template_files()`,
  `existing_model_preflight_template_files()`,
  `field_lifecycle_template_files()`,
  `plan_detailing_template_files()`,
  `risk_evidence_ledger_template_files()`,
  `development_process_flow_template_files()`,
  `project_adoption_template_files()`, `model_miss_review_full_template_files()`,
  `ui_flow_structure_full_template_files()`, `test_mesh_template_files()`,
  `structure_mesh_template_files()`, `closure_contract_template_files()`, and
  `layered_boundary_proof_template_files()`, and
  `runtime_path_evidence_template_files()`. The public facade remains
  `flowguard.templates`; route template text is internally owned by
  route-scoped modules.

These tools are valuable for FlowGuard maintenance. Ordinary project models do
not have to run the full evidence baseline, problem corpus, or benchmark suite
before using `run_model_first_checks`.

## Introspection Constants

The package exports lightweight grouping constants:

- route-scoped discovery groups such as `FLOWGUARD_ROUTE_API`,
  `TEMPLATE_STRUCTURE_API`, `EVIDENCE_FIELD_STRUCTURE_API`,
  `FLOWGUARD_SELF_MAINTENANCE_ROUTE_API`,
  `ARCHITECTURE_REDUCTION_ROUTE_API`,
  `CODE_STRUCTURE_RECOMMENDATION_ROUTE_API`,
  `MODEL_TEST_ALIGNMENT_ROUTE_API`, `MODEL_MISS_REVIEW_ROUTE_API`,
  `MAINTENANCE_OBLIGATION_MEMORY_API`,
  `MODEL_MATURATION_LOOP_API`, and `PLAN_DETAILING_ROUTE_API`
- `CORE_API`
- `REPORTING_HELPER_API`
- `EVIDENCE_API`
- `API_SURFACE`
- `MODELING_HELPER_API`, the complete helper index and migration inventory

They are descriptive lists of exported public names. Runtime policy is enforced
by the runner, audits, templates, and route checks rather than by these grouping
constants alone.

## Agent Guidance

Start with the formal model-first path and keep skipped checks visible. Add
route helpers when they clarify a real risk, reduce repetitive code, or improve
reporting honesty. In an existing modeled system, use Existing Model Preflight to
look up current model responsibilities, FunctionBlocks, state owners,
side-effect owners, and public entrypoints before proposing new ownership or a
parallel workflow. Bind uncertainty to an explicit preflight or blueprint gap
and route that gap to its evidence owner; do not create an open-ended parallel
decision record. When model obligations and tests both exist, use Model-Test
Alignment to compare them directly before claiming coverage agreement; when
code contracts are supplied, also bind each model obligation to the external
code surface and require tests to prove that external contract rather than only
an internal path. When real Python source and tests are available, use
`audit_python_code_contracts()`, `audit_python_test_assertions()`, and
`review_python_contract_source_audit()` to check whether the declared code
contracts and test evidence are supported by AST-visible code and assertions
before trusting the three-way claim; for real-code claims, attach that report to
`ModelTestAlignmentPlan.source_audit_reports` and set
`require_source_audit=True` so missing, red, or unrelated audits block the final
binding row. If the model found a concrete counterexample or known-bad proof,
record it as a `ClosureEvidenceTarget` and require a current external
`counterexample_regression` or `known_bad_replay` test bound to the owner code
contract and the same target id. When related obligations are being treated as
one family-level promise, add `ObligationFamily` and
`ObligationFamilyEvidence` rows so missing sibling mechanisms or wrong
provenance keep the alignment report scoped or blocked. When a post-green bug
exposes a missing class, bind the exact commitment, primary owner, and
blueprint gap; declare finite canonical relations from current
DNA/BCL/topology evidence; project them through ContractExhaustionMesh; emit a
task-bound ModelMaturation contribution; and feed verified maturation,
generated cases, and owner code/test evidence into the final ledger before
claiming full closure. When a code contract is supposed to be a
closed boundary, add `CodeBoundaryContract` and `CodeBoundaryObservation` rows
and run `review_code_boundary_conformance()` so forbidden inputs, unknown
accepted inputs, extra outputs, extra errors, extra state writes, and extra
side effects stay visible. When a project claims FlowGuard protects production
state mutation, add `RuntimeStateSurface`, `RuntimeGatewayContract`,
`RuntimeWriteObservation`, and `RuntimeWriterInventoryEvidence` rows and run
`review_runtime_gateway_adoption()` so complete writer inventory, gateway
ownership, direct-write bypasses, stale observations, and proof-artifact gaps
stay visible. Send ambiguous or complex behavior to manual review and keep
conformance replay for production-facing confidence. When direct
model or validation evidence is oversized, incomplete, slow, broad,
progress-only, or release-only, run AutoSplit, ModelMesh, or TestMesh
separately and consume that route evidence before claiming broad parent
confidence. For
large model or validation meshes, record the target split derivation from the
FlowGuard source model before trusting parent/child ownership and evidence.
After non-trivial FlowGuard-managed work, let DevelopmentProcessFlow compare
changed artifacts directly with remembered owner-route obligations, skipped
checks, stale evidence, and structure/reduction signals, then reopen only the
exact affected owner routes.
When parent confidence claims whole-flow closure, add a
mesh closure model so root entries, child outputs, joins, terminal
dispositions, repeated-input repair feedback, blocker/progress tokens, and
out-of-scope branches are checked as executable handoff obligations before
`mesh_green_can_continue`. When a parent model relies on
child models for confidence, add layered boundary proof so each parent item has
an owner, child ownership is disjoint except for explicit bridge/shared-kernel
cases, current child evidence is reattached to the parent, and each leaf proves
its finite real-code boundary matrix. For large, slow, or layered validation, use TestMesh to
split the parent test gate into child suites/scripts and make their ownership
and evidence visible before trusting the parent. For large structure refactors,
use StructureMesh to make model-derived target structure, child-module
ownership, and compatibility evidence visible before trusting a parent split.
Before turning all of those route reports into a broad done, release, publish,
or production-confidence claim, run `review_flowguard_closure_contract()` so
runtime trace mapping, artifact freshness, model quality, same-class miss
closure, runtime gateway inventory, and Risk Evidence Ledger support are all
current at the claim boundary.
When the incoming work is still a vague idea or thin plan, run
`review_plan_detail()` first and project the resulting rows into PlanIntake,
WorkflowStepContracts, DevelopmentProcessFlow, or AgentWorkflowRehearsal as
needed; do not treat the plan-detail pass as implementation proof.
Use Code Structure Recommendation for direct pre-code architecture
recommendations. Use Architecture Reduction when an existing implementation
has repeated or historical handlers, adapters, modules, branches, validation
layers, or product behaviors whose current-DNA necessity must be decided.
Ordinary contraction still requires observable equivalence or proven facade
delegation; intentional behavior retirement instead requires a complete
current responsibility and consumer disposition. The route should produce a
review and handoff, not rewrite production code. Use UI Flow Structure when a UI's controls, state transitions,
navigation, regions, overlays, menu levels, information displays,
duplicate/redundant content, overlapping controls, or parent/child hierarchy
need a reviewed UI interaction model before layout and visual implementation;
when the claim is complete app-level UI coverage, require UI journey coverage
from launch entry points through declared success, recovery, cancel, exit, and
residual blindspot boundaries before structure or visual handoff. When the
claim is implemented/runnable UI completion, require implementation validation
that aligns feature contracts, reviewed journeys, every reachable enabled
control's real click-through evidence or scoped blindspot, model revision, and
residual implementation blindspots. Use
DevelopmentProcessFlow when staged development or modification work has
validation, or when lifecycle ordering, artifact overwrite, verifier changes,
peer writes, or evidence freshness determine whether the agent can safely
continue or whether a done, release, archive, or publish claim is supported; do
not use it as a universal gate or a supervisor for sibling routes. Before a
final confidence claim, use the Risk Evidence Ledger to check whether each
important user risk has a model obligation, code contract when required, and
current external proof evidence; stale, skipped, progress-only, or
internal-path-only proof can support only a scoped or blocked claim. Do not
claim production confidence from a model-only pass unless conformance replay or
equivalent real-code evidence exists.
When repeated issues or broad completion claims depend on upstream plan
construction, first run the plan-intake, adapter-conformance,
false-negative-backpropagation, mutation, and typed claim-chain helpers so
omitted surfaces or narrow reports cannot be silently upgraded.
## Provider-neutral WorkContext API

`WORK_CONTEXT_API` exposes the adapter registry, project-bounded read and
discovery helpers, and current review. Built-in OpenSpec and declared-files
adapters are peers; declared files can represent Spec Kit, Superpowers,
Spark/OpenSpark, changelog/history, custom skills, or ordinary repository
documents. Exact mapped artifacts may become immutable `ModelIntentContribution`
rows, but only ModelRevisionSet can accept their effects into the current model
lineage. The common layer preserves native
identity and content fingerprints without provider writes, sessions, caches,
receipts, check execution, or lifecycle authority. See
[`work_context.md`](work_context.md). WorkContext belongs to planning and is
intentionally absent from product UI and test-evidence projection.

## Project blueprint and test-inventory API

`IMPLEMENTATION_BLUEPRINT_API` exposes the provider-neutral
`TargetSystemDescriptor`, provider declaration/registry/result, frozen
`TargetSystemSnapshot`, canonical compiler, compact understanding projection,
`canonical_target_system_blueprint_projection`, and the project-specialized
blueprint builder. The canonical target projection returns the existing
`CanonicalBlueprintProjection` envelope and reuses its `BlueprintShard`, writer,
and verifier; it preserves the exact descriptor, frozen evidence, native report
set, and qualification/readiness result rather than creating another export
authority.
The bounded `BlueprintManifestQualificationReport` is compiler-owned internal
data and is therefore absent from `IMPLEMENTATION_BLUEPRINT_API` and the root
package API. Its `static_manifest_status` and `static_manifest_ready` fields
describe only static manifest consistency; project and target readiness remain
the public owners of whole readiness and implementation admission.
The shared disk kernel exposes `CanonicalBlueprintProjection`,
`serialize_canonical_blueprint_projection`,
`write_canonical_blueprint_projection`, and
`load_canonical_blueprint_projection`. The loader's result names its bounded
claim: exact current directory/manifest/content integrity only. Target and
project semantic verifiers separately rebind identity and readiness to their
typed compiler inputs; generic content verification is never described as
sufficient model understanding.

Python AST and pytest are
software observation providers, not a core language gate. The cohort also
contains the strict project document loader, independent implementation inventory,
behavior-block contracts, resource and intent inventories, static blueprint
readiness, project test inventory, topology review, model-test alignment,
deterministic normalized projection, affected-neighborhood loading, and the
FlowGuard self preset. The generic builder reports
`inventory`, `traceability`, `independent_semantics`, `model_code_test`,
`resource_oracle`, and `static_blueprint` independently. A missing deep provider
is an exact capability gap for that boundary; workflows, other languages, and
mixed targets remain valid target kinds.
`ProjectResourceInventory` stores one canonical `BlueprintResourceReference`
per admitted resource category, retaining owner, artifact, current fingerprint,
purpose, lifecycle role, and source-independent semantics. Its category row
adds only independently fingerprinted disposition evidence; it is not a second,
weaker resource authority.
The strict project document embeds the complete `ProjectTestInventory` rather
than only a caller-supplied fingerprint. Loading it re-audits current test
files, nodes, assertions, adapter identity, and structure before those nodes
can satisfy a model-code-test row. The alignment identity is derived from the
newly reviewed `ModelTestAlignmentReport` instead of echoing a caller claim or
reusing the binding-report fingerprint.
Bounded native model checkers are represented separately from pytest nodes and
their current files are independently fingerprinted before use.

`build_project_test_inventory()` records static pytest node ids,
parameterization, calls, assertion kinds and targets, and source/structure
fingerprints. Aggregate full-suite evidence remains a parent reference; it
cannot manufacture a missing child test binding. Ordinary work consumes only
the compact blueprint identity and affected neighborhood unless whole-software
scope was explicitly requested.
`reconcile_pytest_execution()` is the separate runtime companion: a native
pytest adapter supplies exact collected and deselected node ids plus terminal
report rows, and the result preserves concrete parameterized leaves,
selected/executed/reused/not-run state, outcome reasons, and independently
recomputed parent counts. A parent summary or process exit code cannot create
or hide a runtime leaf. The helper does not launch pytest; process supervision,
receipt publication, and environment/toolchain identity remain with the native
execution owner.
`reconcile_contract_exhaustion_execution()` is the corresponding finite-case
boundary for ContractExhaustionMesh. It consumes one current generated-case
report and its finite coverage-universe identity, then reconciles native
executed/reused rows with required, selected, explicitly-not-selected,
not-run, oracle-status, reason, and observed-result fingerprints. Unknown,
missing, conflicting, or aggregate-only rows remain blockers; synthetic
`ContractFaultProfile` rows never count as live execution evidence. This
adapter is also non-executing: the target runner, receipt verifier, and
environment owner remain outside the reconciliation module.

`review_behavior_blueprint()` checks one primary owner for every declared
behavior block, all ten behavior dimensions, portable bindings, placeholder-
free case contracts, explicit evidence-bound supporting-surface relations,
real assertion/native-member coverage, delegated assertion-helper termination,
separate execution evidence, and terminal dispositions for every discovered
test node. `review_static_blueprint_readiness()` then reports
`ready`, `incomplete`, `stale`, or `blocked`, together with every known gap,
the deepest complete layer, and the first incomplete layer. A `ready` static
report means the declared finite blueprint has closed its static evidence
obligations; execution receipts remain separate.

`review_flowguard_self_architecture_reduction()` is a read-only self-audit. It
derives module-size, repeated-shape, route, branch, adapter, wrapper/facade,
helper, and repeated-validation candidates independently from the exact self
blueprint, binds the complete candidate denominator to a fingerprint, and routes
unproved candidates to StructureMesh and ModelTestAlignment. It never treats
size or shape resemblance as equivalence proof and never edits source code.
The same observed inventory and reverse caller index also feed step-level
assessments, so repeated scans, reflections, evidence projections,
fingerprints, and token-facing payload materializations do not require a
second whole-project scan. A high-cost step remains retained or unresolved if
it still uniquely owns a safety rule or final evidence responsibility.
`SelfReductionEvidenceNeighborhood` and
`SelfReductionEvidenceNeighborhoodCatalog` store an identical candidate test,
coverage, dimension, and current-receipt neighborhood once. Candidate-local
observable contracts bind one exact catalog fingerprint and resolve fail-closed;
proof records remain self-contained.
