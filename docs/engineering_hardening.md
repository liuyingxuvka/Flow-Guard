# Engineering Hardening

Phase 15 adds thin adoption surfaces around the existing Python API. The goal
is to make proven checks easier to run without changing the mathematical core.

## Stable Artifacts

`flowguard.schema` wraps traces and reports in a deterministic envelope:

- `schema_version`;
- `artifact_type`;
- `created_by`;
- `model_name`;
- `scenario_name`;
- `trace_id`;
- `payload`.

Use `trace_artifact()` and `report_artifact()` when a trace or report needs to
be saved or compared as a stable machine-readable artifact.

## Command Wrappers

`python -m flowguard` provides thin wrappers around existing Python APIs:

```powershell
python -m flowguard benchmark
python -m flowguard coverage
python -m flowguard hardening
python -m flowguard loop-review
python -m flowguard scenario-review
python -m flowguard conformance
python -m flowguard schema-version
```

The CLI is intentionally small. It should not hide expected-vs-observed
statuses, `needs_human_review`, or known limitations.

The documented model-backed wrappers are also available from a clean,
non-editable wheel: the wheel carries the maintained `examples` packages used
by these commands. A consumer check must execute at least one command such as
`scenario-review`; a successful `--help` or package import is only an entry
point smoke check and does not prove that the command's runtime dependencies
are installed.

## Templates

`flowguard.templates.project_template_files()` returns starter files for a
basic model-first workflow:

- `model.py`;
- `run_checks.py`.

The package also exposes public-safe scaffolds for common agent situations:

- `risk_intent_template_files()`: a Risk Intent + `FlowGuardCheckPlan`
  starter with model-level confidence boundaries;
- `model_miss_review_template_files()`: a bug-repair/model-miss review starter
  for non-trivial bug repairs or cases where real validation finds a gap after
  a FlowGuard pass;
- `model_test_alignment_template_files()`: a direct model-obligation to
  ordinary test-evidence alignment starter;
- `maintenance_workflow_template_files()`: a recurring maintenance workflow
  starter.

The helpers return content instead of writing files so callers can decide where
and how to create project files. The CLI can print or write the same templates:

```powershell
python -m flowguard project-template --output .
python -m flowguard risk-intent-template --output .
python -m flowguard model-miss-template --output .
python -m flowguard model-test-alignment-template --output .
python -m flowguard maintenance-template --output .
```

## Pytest Adapter

`flowguard.pytest_adapter` exposes assertion helpers without importing pytest:

- `assert_report_ok(report)`;
- `assert_no_executable_corpus_regression(report)`.

These helpers let projects integrate flowguard checks into pytest while keeping
the core package free of external dependencies.

## Adoption Logging

Phase 16 adds `flowguard.adoption` as a lightweight record layer for real
project pilots:

- `AdoptionCommandResult`;
- `AdoptionLogEntry`;
- `AdoptionTimer`;
- `append_jsonl()`;
- `append_markdown_log()`.

Use `.flowguard/adoption_log.jsonl` for machine-readable entries and
`docs/flowguard_adoption_log.md` for a human-readable project log. The log
should record status, trigger reason, elapsed time, files touched, checks run,
findings, counterexamples, skipped steps, friction, and next actions.

Logging does not replace executable checks. It exists so repeated real use can
show where flowguard is useful, where it is slow, and where the workflow needs
better templates or math.

Adoption status should be one of `in_progress`, `completed`, `blocked`,
`skipped_with_reason`, or `failed`. Only `completed` means the adoption evidence
is final and successful.
