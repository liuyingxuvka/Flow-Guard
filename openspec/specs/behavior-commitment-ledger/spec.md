# behavior-commitment-ledger Specification

## Purpose
Define the canonical external-promise ledger, source coverage, single-owner accounting, typed behavior-plane relationships, and path-authority handoff required for broad confidence.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Ledger records all in-scope behavior commitments
FlowGuard SHALL provide a Behavior Commitment Ledger that records every
in-scope external behavior promise for the selected project, work package, or
release boundary.

#### Scenario: Complete commitment is accepted
- **WHEN** a commitment names a stable id, label, actor, trigger, expected result, failure boundary, source refs, primary owner model id, validation boundary, and rationale
- **THEN** the ledger review SHALL treat the commitment as registered

#### Scenario: Missing commitment blocks full coverage
- **WHEN** an expected in-scope commitment id is absent from the ledger
- **THEN** the ledger review SHALL report `expected_commitment_missing`
- **AND** the report SHALL NOT support broad confidence

### Requirement: Source surfaces and commitments map both ways
FlowGuard SHALL require in-scope source surfaces to map to commitments and
in-scope commitments to trace back to source surfaces.

#### Scenario: Source surface has no commitment
- **WHEN** a public source surface is in scope and has no commitment ids
- **THEN** the ledger review SHALL report `source_surface_missing_commitment`

#### Scenario: Commitment has no source evidence
- **WHEN** a commitment is in scope and has no source refs
- **THEN** the ledger review SHALL report `commitment_missing_source_ref`

### Requirement: Each commitment has one primary owner model
FlowGuard SHALL require exactly one primary owner model for each in-scope
commitment and SHALL treat supporting or child models as subordinate coverage.

#### Scenario: Missing primary owner blocks
- **WHEN** an in-scope commitment has no primary owner model id
- **THEN** the ledger review SHALL report `commitment_missing_primary_owner`

#### Scenario: Primary owner overlaps supporting owner
- **WHEN** a commitment lists the same model as both primary and supporting or child
- **THEN** the ledger review SHALL report `primary_owner_also_supporting`

### Requirement: Dependencies remain explicit and closed
FlowGuard SHALL represent runtime commitment relationships as typed `relations` that reference registered commitments within the same ledger boundary and obey the declared same-plane/cross-plane relation matrix. Legacy `dependency_commitment_ids` SHALL be accepted only by the explicit artifact-upgrade boundary.

#### Scenario: Unknown dependency blocks
- **WHEN** a commitment depends on an unknown commitment id
- **THEN** the ledger review SHALL report `commitment_dependency_unknown`

#### Scenario: Unknown relation target blocks
- **WHEN** a relation refers to an unknown commitment id
- **THEN** the ledger review SHALL report `commitment_relation_target_unknown`

#### Scenario: Cross-plane relation lacks rationale
- **WHEN** a relation crosses behavior planes without a non-empty rationale
- **THEN** the ledger review SHALL report `commitment_cross_plane_relation_missing_rationale`

#### Scenario: Relation direction is invalid
- **WHEN** a relation type and source/target plane pair is outside the declared relation matrix
- **THEN** the ledger review SHALL report `commitment_relation_plane_mismatch`

#### Scenario: Deterministic same-plane legacy dependency migrates
- **WHEN** a legacy dependency target exists and both commitments are deterministically classified in the same plane
- **THEN** the upgrader SHALL convert it to a `depends_on` relation

#### Scenario: Ambiguous legacy dependency requires review
- **WHEN** a legacy dependency crosses planes or either plane cannot be determined
- **THEN** the upgrader SHALL keep migration incomplete and require an explicit typed relation decision

### Requirement: Scoped-out behavior remains accountable
FlowGuard SHALL require scoped-out, deferred, removed, deprecated, or replaced
behavior rows to record owner, reason, validation boundary, and rationale.

#### Scenario: Scoped-out row lacks reason
- **WHEN** a commitment or source surface is scoped out without reason, owner, validation boundary, or rationale
- **THEN** the ledger review SHALL report `scoped_out_behavior_missing_disposition`

### Requirement: Path-sensitive commitments consume Primary Path Authority
FlowGuard SHALL require each path-sensitive behavior commitment to carry
Primary Path Authority evidence and SHALL treat blocked PPA decisions as
blocked commitment coverage.

#### Scenario: Path-sensitive commitment lacks PPA evidence
- **WHEN** a commitment is marked `path_sensitive=true` and has no PPA report, decision, receipt, or risk gate id
- **THEN** the ledger review SHALL report `commitment_missing_primary_path_authority`

#### Scenario: PPA blocked result blocks commitment
- **WHEN** a path-sensitive commitment carries a blocked PPA decision
- **THEN** the ledger review SHALL report `commitment_primary_path_blocked`
- **AND** the report SHALL NOT support broad confidence

### Requirement: Ledger exposes downstream evidence ids
FlowGuard SHALL expose commitment coverage case ids, test shard ids, risk gate
ids, and PPA evidence ids so downstream routes consume the same boundary.

#### Scenario: Report includes downstream ids
- **WHEN** a ledger review includes registered commitments with evidence bindings
- **THEN** the report SHALL expose covered commitment ids, path-sensitive commitment ids, PPA-blocked commitment ids, and required risk gate ids

### Requirement: Ledger supports finite Cartesian coverage planning
FlowGuard SHALL provide canonical ContractExhaustionMesh axes and interaction
groups for behavior commitment coverage.

#### Scenario: Coverage universe includes PPA axis
- **WHEN** a ledger coverage plan is generated
- **THEN** the plan SHALL include source mapping, owner state, evidence state, dependency state, path sensitivity, PPA result, and release gate axes

### Requirement: Ledger classifies behavior change mode
FlowGuard SHALL classify behavior-ledger work as bootstrap, add, change,
remove/replace, historical gap backfill, or model-miss check before broad
behavior claims.

#### Scenario: Unknown change mode blocks
- **WHEN** a ledger carries an unknown change mode
- **THEN** the ledger review SHALL report `ledger_unknown_change_mode`

### Requirement: Source freshness blocks stale broad claims
FlowGuard SHALL require in-scope behavior source surfaces to be current before
broad behavior confidence.

#### Scenario: Source changed after ledger review
- **WHEN** an in-scope source surface is marked changed, missing, or unchecked
- **THEN** the ledger review SHALL report `source_surface_freshness_not_current`

### Requirement: Replaced behavior has no alternate success surface
FlowGuard SHALL require replaced or removed behavior to be explicitly disposed
instead of preserved as an alternate successful path.

#### Scenario: Replaced behavior lacks replacement disposition
- **WHEN** a commitment is marked replaced without a replacement commitment id or excluded behavior ids
- **THEN** the ledger review SHALL report `commitment_replacement_disposition_missing`

### Requirement: Model miss backfeed checks existing commitments first
FlowGuard SHALL treat model misses as a backfeed check against existing
commitments and SHALL only backfill a commitment when no existing commitment
covers the observed external behavior.

#### Scenario: Model miss backfeed lacks current owner or DCAR coverage
- **WHEN** a commitment records a model miss origin without current model-sync and coverage-case evidence
- **THEN** the ledger review SHALL report `commitment_model_miss_backfeed_incomplete`

### Requirement: Process strategy selection has one development-process commitment
The Behavior Commitment Ledger SHALL preserve exactly one `development_process` commitment, intent id, and executable child-model owner for conditional process optimization. Its precondition SHALL be an explicit optimization request, multiple outcome-equivalent viable routes, material repeated-work risk, or a real diagnostic-boundary choice. Its expected result SHALL be one evidence-grounded diagnostic boundary and execution mode, visible hard blockers/not-run work, traceable repair groups, affected revalidation, and material-change freshness; DPF/API/agent guidance SHALL remain typed source surfaces of this one commitment without merging product or agent-operation ownership.

#### Scenario: Public DPF guidance references optimization
- **WHEN** DPF skill guidance promises conditional process optimization
- **THEN** its source surface maps to the existing single commitment and not to a new or duplicate commitment

#### Scenario: Ordinary lifecycle work has no optimizer precondition
- **WHEN** a non-trivial task has one clear route and no material optimization reason
- **THEN** the commitment remains registered but is not activated for that plan

### Requirement: Active commitments bind exact observed model instances
Every in-scope active behavior commitment SHALL resolve to exactly one primary
model instance in the observed-head snapshot. Supporting and child owners SHALL
also use immutable instance references.

#### Scenario: Owner model artifact changes
- **WHEN** a commitment names a logical model id whose artifact or purpose fingerprint no longer matches the observed snapshot member
- **THEN** the commitment is stale and cannot satisfy current behavior coverage

### Requirement: Replaced and retired commitments do not rank as current
Behavior commitment lookup SHALL exclude replaced and retired commitments from
primary current results while preserving them as historical context.

#### Scenario: Retired commitment text matches exactly
- **WHEN** a retired commitment has a stronger lexical match than an active commitment
- **THEN** lookup selects the active same-plane commitment and reports the retired match only as historical context

### Requirement: Expected behavior-source inventory is derived independently
Before claiming broad behavior coverage, the system SHALL derive one immutable expected behavior-source inventory from the declared project boundary and the current native source inventories, independently of Behavior Commitment Ledger rows and caller-selected candidates. The expected inventory SHALL record its boundary, revision, fingerprint, exact item identities, source roles, source kinds, content references, and native owner references.

#### Scenario: A source is absent from an otherwise green ledger
- **WHEN** the independent expected inventory contains an in-scope item that is absent from the ledger reconciliation
- **THEN** broad behavior coverage SHALL remain blocked and SHALL identify the missing expected item

#### Scenario: An expected source changes after reconciliation
- **WHEN** the identity, content, role, or native owner of an expected source item changes
- **THEN** the previous reconciliation SHALL become stale and SHALL NOT support a current coverage claim

### Requirement: Every expected item has exactly one coverage disposition
The system SHALL reconcile every item in the expected behavior-source inventory with exactly one disposition: `modeled`, `delegated`, or `scoped`. A `modeled` item SHALL reference its Behavior Commitment, exactly one primary owner model, and current evidence. A `delegated` item SHALL reference exactly one native owner inventory, a typed delegation relation, and current native evidence. A `scoped` item SHALL record its scope owner, reason, and validation boundary. Missing, duplicate, or conflicting dispositions SHALL block broad coverage.

#### Scenario: One expected item has no disposition
- **WHEN** an expected item is present in the independent inventory but has no modeled, delegated, or scoped disposition
- **THEN** the reconciliation SHALL fail and SHALL report that exact item as uncovered

#### Scenario: One expected item is claimed twice
- **WHEN** two successful dispositions claim the same expected item
- **THEN** the reconciliation SHALL fail instead of accepting two independent success paths

#### Scenario: A specialist-owned item is delegated
- **WHEN** a UI, field, provider, or other specialist inventory remains the native semantic owner of an expected item
- **THEN** the ledger SHALL preserve that ownership through a typed delegated disposition and SHALL NOT recreate the specialist's classification

### Requirement: Source roles and normative conflicts remain explicit
The system SHALL preserve the role and authority lane of every expected source, including normative requirements, observed behavior, generated inventories, and contextual work artifacts. It SHALL detect and expose incompatible normative sources and normative-to-observed mismatches instead of silently choosing the last or most convenient source.

#### Scenario: Two normative sources disagree
- **WHEN** two current normative sources declare incompatible behavior for the same business intent
- **THEN** the ledger SHALL record a visible conflict and SHALL block a singular current commitment until the conflict has one owned disposition

#### Scenario: Observed behavior disagrees with the normative source
- **WHEN** current observed behavior differs from the selected normative commitment
- **THEN** the system SHALL preserve both roles, route the mismatch through the existing miss or repair owner, and SHALL NOT treat the observed behavior as an implicit normative replacement

### Requirement: Each exact business intent has one active commitment
Behavior Commitment Ledger SHALL assign one stable exact
`business_intent_id` and exactly one active commitment to each in-scope
external behavior promise. Exact identity SHALL be determined from the actor,
trigger and preconditions, expected result and terminal, failure boundary, and
material externally relevant state writes and side effects. Different UI, API,
CLI, alias, adapter, wrapper, helper, or compatibility surfaces for that exact
intent SHALL map to the same commitment.

#### Scenario: Multiple surfaces expose one exact intent
- **WHEN** several declared surfaces have the same actor, trigger and preconditions, expected result and terminal, failure boundary, material state writes, and side effects
- **THEN** the ledger SHALL map every surface to one stable business-intent id and one active commitment id

#### Scenario: Duplicate active commitments cover one exact intent
- **WHEN** two active commitment rows claim the same exact business-intent identity
- **THEN** the ledger review SHALL report a duplicate exact-intent commitment blocker and SHALL NOT support broad confidence

#### Scenario: A genuinely different intent remains separate
- **WHEN** a candidate commitment has a material externally observable difference in actor, trigger or preconditions, expected result or terminal, failure boundary, state writes, side effects, or safety semantics
- **THEN** the ledger SHALL require the difference, owner, validation boundary, rationale, and current evidence before accepting a distinct business-intent id

### Requirement: Delegating surfaces do not create delegate commitments
An additional surface that only delegates to the selected primary path SHALL be
recorded through the existing source-surface mapping and PPA candidate or facade
disposition. Behavior Commitment Ledger SHALL NOT create a delegate commitment,
surface commitment, or compatibility commitment whose only promise is to invoke
the same exact business intent.

#### Scenario: Compatibility facade delegates to the primary path
- **WHEN** an API alias, UI control, CLI command, adapter, wrapper, or compatibility facade adds no independent validation, terminal, state write, side effect, or success decision and delegates to the selected primary path
- **THEN** the ledger SHALL map that surface to the existing commitment without creating another commitment row

#### Scenario: Surface owns material behavior
- **WHEN** a proposed surface performs independent business validation, terminal selection, material state writes, side effects, or success behavior
- **THEN** the ledger SHALL treat it as a duplicate-path or distinct-intent question for the existing BCL/PPA owners rather than legitimizing it through a delegate commitment

### Requirement: Path-sensitive commitment bindings are singular and green
Each path-sensitive commitment SHALL bind to exactly one singular
`primary_path_id` whose PPA decision is current and green for the same stable
business-intent id. A report id, risk-gate id, receipt id, or free-form evidence
reference without a green singular path binding SHALL NOT satisfy broad
commitment coverage.

#### Scenario: Current green singular binding passes
- **WHEN** a path-sensitive commitment carries one primary path id, matching exact business-intent identity, current green PPA decision, and current runtime and proof evidence
- **THEN** the ledger review SHALL accept the PPA binding for the declared commitment scope

#### Scenario: Retired plural path input is not a runtime route
- **WHEN** normal runtime input supplies retired `primary_path_ids` or
  `legacy_primary_path_ids`
- **THEN** the ledger loader SHALL reject the input instead of migrating,
  aliasing, or selecting a list element
- **AND** historical file migration SHALL remain owned by the exact bounded
  artifact upgrader

#### Scenario: Scoped or opaque PPA reference is insufficient
- **WHEN** a path-sensitive commitment carries a PPA reference but the decision is scoped, missing, stale, blocked, not current, or lacks the selected primary path and material proof
- **THEN** the ledger SHALL keep commitment coverage scoped or blocked instead of treating the reference as passed

### Requirement: Commitments declare one behavior plane
Every in-scope commitment SHALL declare exactly one production behavior plane: `product_runtime`, `agent_operation`, or `development_process`.

#### Scenario: Commitment form and plane are distinct
- **WHEN** a commitment declares a `commitment_kind` such as `ui`, `cli`, `workflow`, or `process`
- **THEN** ledger review SHALL still require a separate valid `behavior_plane`

#### Scenario: Unclassified migration row cannot pass
- **WHEN** an upgrade cannot classify a legacy commitment and records it as `unclassified` in migration diagnostics
- **THEN** the runtime ledger SHALL reject the row for broad confidence until it is classified

### Requirement: Commitments declare structured actor kind
Every commitment SHALL declare one actor kind from `end_user`, `external_system`, `application`, `ai_agent`, `developer`, or `automation`, while retaining a human-readable actor label.

#### Scenario: Free-text actor lacks kind
- **WHEN** a commitment has an actor label but no valid actor kind
- **THEN** ledger review SHALL report `commitment_actor_kind_missing_or_invalid`

### Requirement: Commitments expose bounded lookup bindings
The ledger SHALL support task terms, path patterns, tool ids, error signatures, and workflow families as optional lookup bindings without making those bindings a second behavior authority.

#### Scenario: Model miss adds reusable error signature
- **WHEN** a same-plane Model Miss produces a stable observed error signature
- **THEN** the owning commitment MAY add that signature to its lookup binding
- **AND** the commitment id and primary owner model SHALL remain unchanged

### Requirement: Canonical project ledger is machine-readable
Project templates SHALL store behavior commitments in one canonical
`.flowguard/behavior/inventory/ledger.json` artifact and SHALL treat generated
check results as evidence rather than source data. The behavior ledger model
and native runner are separate current owners under
`.flowguard/models/owners/behavior_commitment_ledger/model.py` and
`.flowguard/verification/owners/behavior_commitment_ledger/run_checks.py`.

#### Scenario: Project model loads canonical ledger
- **WHEN** the generated project BCL model is imported
- **THEN** it SHALL load and validate `ledger.json`
- **AND** SHALL NOT reconstruct a separate embedded commitment inventory

#### Scenario: Result artifact cannot become source
- **WHEN** `run_checks.py` writes `result.json`
- **THEN** later ledger loading SHALL continue to read `ledger.json`, not the prior result

### Requirement: Legacy ledger migration is boundary-only
FlowGuard SHALL provide dry-run and apply migration for the known legacy artifact shape and SHALL NOT execute unknown custom Python ledgers during conversion.

#### Scenario: Dry-run is non-mutating
- **WHEN** the upgrader reviews a legacy ledger without apply mode
- **THEN** it SHALL report proposed plane, actor, relation, and source changes without modifying the source or target

#### Scenario: Unknown custom Python requires manual conversion
- **WHEN** a Python ledger does not match the known official template shape
- **THEN** the upgrader SHALL report a manual-conversion blocker
- **AND** SHALL NOT execute that file to obtain commitments

#### Scenario: Migration activates one authority
- **WHEN** a canonical ledger conversion is applied successfully
- **THEN** the project adapter SHALL load only the canonical ledger
- **AND** the legacy embedded inventory SHALL no longer be an active success path

### Requirement: New templates use plane-aware commitment ids
New generated commitments SHALL default to `commitment:product:*`, `commitment:agent:*`, or `commitment:development:*` ids while preserving existing ids during the first migration when references remain valid.

#### Scenario: Existing id remains stable
- **WHEN** a legacy commitment can be classified without changing its semantic identity
- **THEN** migration SHALL preserve its id and update only the new plane-aware fields and relations

### Requirement: Ledger mode controls discovery breadth
Behavior Commitment Ledger discovery SHALL derive broad historical source
inventory only for `bootstrap_ledger` and `coverage_gap_backfill`. Existing
project add, change, remove/replace, and model-miss modes SHALL default to the
affected commitments and explicitly admitted source mappings.

#### Scenario: Existing behavior changes
- **WHEN** mode is `change_behavior` and the affected commitment and source
  identities are known
- **THEN** inventory SHALL remain bounded to the affected closure and SHALL NOT
  scan every historical source merely because broad-confidence fields exist

#### Scenario: Coverage gap is being backfilled
- **WHEN** mode is `coverage_gap_backfill`
- **THEN** the ledger SHALL require broad independent discovery and preserve
  every expected item disposition

#### Scenario: Mode is omitted for an existing ledger
- **WHEN** a current non-empty ledger is reviewed without an explicit mode
- **THEN** FlowGuard SHALL infer an affected existing-project review or block
  ambiguity and SHALL NOT silently select bootstrap-wide discovery

### Requirement: Triggered commitment coverage contributes to maturation
Behavior Commitment Ledger SHALL project the in-scope external-promise source inventory, current primary owners, and open coverage or path-authority gaps into task-local maturation when behavior commitment review is triggered.

#### Scenario: Target-domain role remains target-owned
- **WHEN** a commitment references a target application's administrator, approver, member, or other domain role
- **THEN** FlowGuard MUST treat that role identity as target-owned behavior context and MUST NOT add it to a global FlowGuard role taxonomy

#### Scenario: Commitment is omitted from candidate coverage
- **WHEN** an independently inventoried in-scope external promise is not represented by the candidate model
- **THEN** maturation MUST retain the promise as an uncovered item

### Requirement: Understanding and admission behaviors have one primary implementation owner
The behavior ledger SHALL register task-demand derivation, maturation receipt publication and verification, implementation admission, broad-confidence decision, and closure integrity with exactly one current primary implementation owner each.

#### Scenario: Two modules claim primary confidence ownership
- **WHEN** more than one current implementation owner claims the final broad-confidence behavior
- **THEN** the ledger audit fails with duplicate primary ownership

### Requirement: Behavior sources are external promises, not implementation self-description
Behavior Commitment Ledger SHALL register normative requirements, public
contracts, user-visible workflow declarations, and other sources that state an
external behavior promise. Production modules, helper modules, executable
self-model files, tests, generated inventories, and validation receipts SHALL
retain their exact relationship to the commitment through the software
blueprint, implementation inventory, Model-Test Alignment, or TestMesh and
SHALL NOT act as the BCL source authority for that promise.

#### Scenario: Implementation currently describes its own commitment
- **WHEN** a BCL source row points to a production, helper, executable-model, or test file as the source of an external promise
- **THEN** the commitment remains blocked from broad external-promise confidence until an exact current normative or public-contract source is bound
- **AND** the code or test file remains traceable only through its native blueprint or evidence owner

#### Scenario: Normative source and implementation binding coexist
- **WHEN** a commitment cites a current OpenSpec requirement or public workflow contract and the software blueprint separately binds its implementation and tests
- **THEN** BCL owns the intended external promise while the blueprint and test owners own realization evidence without duplicate authority

#### Scenario: Generated evidence is offered as intent
- **WHEN** a generated inventory, result, receipt, or current file fingerprint is the only proposed source for a commitment
- **THEN** BCL rejects it as normative authority even if the artifact is mechanically fresh

### Requirement: Behavior source freshness is derived from current project files
Behavior Commitment Ledger SHALL derive physical source freshness from the
current project root instead of trusting a stored status. The existing ledger
owner SHALL resolve direct, anchored, semicolon-composite, and bounded-glob
source references into one sorted unique project-relative file inventory,
fingerprint every file with the canonical source-byte policy, derive each
surface content identity and the complete inventory identity deterministically,
and keep authored semantic fingerprints separate from mechanical source
identity.

#### Scenario: Checked-in source inventory is current
- **WHEN** every expected source reference resolves safely to its exact current file set and every stored surface and inventory fingerprint equals the deterministic live derivation
- **THEN** the live source-inventory review SHALL accept the physical source identity as current
- **AND** the ordinary review SHALL perform no write

#### Scenario: One source file changes after ledger publication
- **WHEN** any resolved source file content changes while the stored ledger row remains unchanged
- **THEN** the live review SHALL report the exact stale surface and block broad behavior confidence
- **AND** a handwritten `freshness_state=current` SHALL NOT override the mismatch

#### Scenario: Composite or glob membership changes
- **WHEN** a semicolon-composite or bounded-glob reference gains, loses, duplicates, or resolves a different project file
- **THEN** the surface content identity and top inventory identity SHALL change
- **AND** the previous inventory revision SHALL be stale

#### Scenario: Source reference is missing or unsafe
- **WHEN** a source reference is absolute, escapes the project root, reaches an unsafe link, resolves no files, or includes a missing file or invalid anchor
- **THEN** the live review SHALL fail visibly without guessing a replacement path or silently narrowing the inventory

#### Scenario: Explicit refresh is requested
- **WHEN** a caller explicitly asks the existing BCL owner to refresh an otherwise valid ledger
- **THEN** the owner SHALL return one immutable ledger value whose source rows, discovery evidence, top fingerprint, and inventory revision all come from the same derivation
- **AND** commitment decisions and authored semantic fingerprints SHALL remain unchanged
