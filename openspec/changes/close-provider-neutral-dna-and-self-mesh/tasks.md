## 1. OpenSpec and public contract

- [x] 1.1 Confirm the existing target-system registry and layer-plan types are the only provider/profile authority.
- [x] 1.2 Add provider-neutral declaration and qualification result types with explicit statuses and claim boundary.
- [x] 1.3 Export the new types through the existing public module without adding an alternate import path.

## 2. Registry admission

- [x] 2.1 Validate unique provider ids, profile ids, target kinds, layer plans, and owners.
- [x] 2.2 Reject duplicate provider/profile-owner declarations with a deterministic error reason.
- [x] 2.3 Reject unknown profiles and unsupported target kinds without fallback registration.
- [x] 2.4 Add tests for valid admission, duplicate rejection, unknown profile rejection, and deterministic ordering.

## 3. Self-DNA qualification

- [x] 3.1 Add separate static, semantic, code-binding, and test-binding status projections.
- [x] 3.2 Require current semantic mesh status and exact parent-child fingerprints for qualified self-DNA.
- [x] 3.3 Require exact code-owner and test-owner bindings; keep missing, stale, candidate, and unknown reasons visible.
- [x] 3.4 Make ordinary qualification close the native directory's model,
  bindings, and current evidence; do not add a target-generation phase.
- [x] 3.5 Add tests for static-ready/semantic-stale, candidate-mesh blocked, fully qualified, and native-directory-only request separation.
- [x] 3.6 Remove standalone self/project portable-export, copied-directory-export, bundle-verify, and directory-materialization command routes.
- [x] 3.7 Remove the standalone portable-blueprint module from the public package surface; retain only in-place native-directory audit/reader behavior.
- [x] 3.8 Update current specs, docs, prompts, and tests so ordinary routes
  advertise the native directory and its model/code/test evidence as the DNA,
  without a second target authority.
- [x] 3.9 Add a negative test that any standalone DNA artifact request fails without writing or changing authority.

## 4. Reduction truthfulness

- [x] 4.1 Add independent inventory-complete, proof-complete, and applied-and-verified fields to the reduction projection.
- [x] 4.2 Preserve unresolved candidates and ensure cleanup-release-ready is false when any required proof or application step is missing.
- [x] 4.3 Add tests covering unresolved candidates, proven-but-unapplied candidates, and applied-and-verified simplification.

## 5. Validation and downstream handoff

- [x] 5.0 Remove all product-specific owner mappings from the public runtime;
  require each target project to provide and fingerprint its own current native
  owner declaration, with no self-map or run-all fallback.
- [x] 5.0a Add the atomic current-only authority rebuild command. It must use
  the old authority section only as opaque CAS bytes, validate a clean staging
  generation-one to accepted-v5 package, replace the pointer last, audit the
  new head, and remove only unreachable old model-mesh objects.
- [x] 5.1 Run focused FlowGuard tests, project-audit, and the relevant OpenSpec verification.
- [x] 5.2 Update the FlowGuard adoption log with model files, commands, evidence identities, and skipped work.
- [ ] 5.3 Install the source projection only after author-side SkillGuard checks are current and passing.
- [ ] 5.4 Hand the provider-neutral contract to ResearchGuard, PhysicsGuard, and WorldGuard without embedding their domain logic in FlowGuard.

### External-owner evidence contract

Tasks 5.3 and 5.4 remain open because their terminal owners are outside this
repository and cannot be honestly closed by local focused tests. They must not
be marked complete from a local import, a copied projection, or a caller
boolean.

- Task 5.3 requires a current author-side SkillGuard receipt for the exact
  source/projection identity, with the owning check, terminal status, and
  receipt fingerprint. Missing or stale author evidence remains `blocked`.
- Task 5.4 requires one handoff receipt per downstream owner (ResearchGuard,
  PhysicsGuard, and WorldGuard) that names the provider-neutral contract
  identity and preserves domain semantics in the downstream owner. A missing
  downstream owner remains `not_run` or `blocked`; `not_applicable` is valid
  only when that owner records a target-scoped reason and it still does not
  satisfy a required broad DNA layer.
